**Hemp sector suggestion for the 2028-2032 CAP:**

**0,5% THC threshold and marketing standards**

 

Executive Summary

The European hemp sector calls for the establishment of a harmonised THC threshold of 0.5% at EU level, alongside the possibility to apply marketing standards to hemp products where necessary. In the context of the revision of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the establishment of new rules for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the period 2028-2034, this paper argues that these measures are legally sound, scientifically justified, proportionate, and complementary.

A harmonized 0.5% THC threshold would **strengthen the internal market**, **ensure legal certainty** for farmers and breeders, **restore competitiveness** vis-à-vis global producers, and **reflect agronomic and climatic realities**, while posing no risk of abuse or public health harm. At the same time, enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp would provide the Union with an appropriate regulatory tool to **ensure product quality, transparency, and fair competition**, and to **protect the internal market** against fraudulent or non-compliant products, including from imports.

Taken together, these measures would allow the hemp sector to fully contribute to EU objectives under the bioeconomy, climate, and industrial policy frameworks, while ensuring a coherent, robust, and future-proof regulatory framework aligned with the principles of proportionality, market integrity, and consumer protection.

**1\.**      **Background and Policy Context**

Industrial hemp is a versatile agricultural crop cultivated in the European Union for fibres, seeds, food, feed, and a growing range of bio-based and innovative applications. Thanks to its low environmental footprint, its capacity to support circular value chains, and its contribution to rural development, hemp increasingly occupies a strategic position at the intersection of agricultural, environmental, climate, and industrial policy. It is explicitly recognised as a relevant crop within the Union’s bioeconomy framework and as a contributor to objectives under the European Green Deal, including climate mitigation, resource efficiency, and sustainable production.

Its regulation has historically relied on the distinction between *Cannabis sativa* L. intended for industrial purposes and cannabis varieties intended for medical or narcotic use, with the THC content of the plant consistently serving as the defining criterion for this distinction.

The revision of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, following the [proposal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52025PC0553&qid=1752763283049) of the European Commission\[1\], and the publication of the [proposal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52025PC0560) for a new regulation on the implementation of the CAP\[2\] offer a timely and appropriate opportunity to address both aspects. Importantly, the European Parliament has already expressed its position in its [own-initiative report](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0189_EN.html)\[3\], explicitly calling for the establishment of a harmonised THC threshold for industrial hemp varieties and indicating 0.5% THC as a proportionate reference point. Strengthening the regulatory framework at EU level would not only enhance legal certainty and internal market coherence, but also unlock the research, innovation, and competitiveness potential of hemp as a strategic crop at the intersection of climate, environmental, agricultural, and industrial policy. This position paper builds on that institutional momentum.

**2\.**      **Why a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold is needed**

A harmonised THC threshold is first and foremost necessary **to** **ensure the proper functioning of the internal market**. At present, farmers and breeders operate under a patchwork of national rules. Some Member States tolerate THC levels approaching 0.6%, others apply stricter interpretations, while countries such as Czechia allow up to 1%. Switzerland, as a member of the European Economic Area, also applies a THC-threshold of 1%. This fragmentation undermines legal certainty and equal treatment. Farmers cultivating the same variety under comparable agronomic conditions may face radically different legal consequences depending solely on the Member State in which they operate. Breeders are discouraged from investing in innovation, and seed circulation across borders is constrained.

The proposed threshold of 0.5% represents not an innovation, but **a restoration of a historically established and proportionate standard**. This limit was already applied in the EU under [Regulation (EEC) No 2059/84](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/1984/2059/oj/eng) from 1984 until 1987\. Its subsequent reduction was not supported by clear scientific or agronomic justification and resulted in an increasingly restrictive framework.

In an **international context**, it is also important to distinguish between regulatory approaches within the EU and those applied in third countries. Several hemp-producing countries outside the EU apply substantially higher thresholds, in some cases up to 2% (South Africa). While the present proposal does not seek to align the EU framework with these higher limits, acknowledging their existence provides a relevant benchmark for international comparison. In many non-EU markets, hemp varieties with THC levels of 0.5% or even up to 1% are legally cultivated, offering higher resilience, better yields, and greater efficiency. At the same time, the EU market is increasingly supplied with imported hemp-derived products produced under these more permissive regimes. Establishing a threshold of 0.5% would therefore represent a measured and proportionate position that strengthens the EU’s credibility and negotiating position, while **improving the international competitiveness of European hemp producers**.

Furthermore, the current 0.3% threshold fails **to** **reflect agronomic realities**. While THC content is genetically influenced, it is also affected by environmental factors such as temperature, sunlight, soil composition, and farming practices. Even when farmers strictly comply with cultivation requirements, natural variations can lead registered varieties to marginally exceed 0.3%, exposing farmers to sanctions despite acting in good faith. A threshold of 0.5% would introduce a necessary margin that prevents accidental non-compliance while fully preserving the non-narcotic character of industrial hemp.

This adjustment would also significantly **benefit research, breeding, and innovation**. Currently, European breeders operate with a very limited genetic pool. A slightly higher threshold would enable access to a broader range of genetic material, supporting the development of new varieties that are more resilient, multi-purpose, and adapted to diverse European conditions. Climate change further reinforces this need. Rising temperatures and evolving growing environments may naturally increase THC expression in hemp plants. Updating the threshold would prevent farmers from being penalised for climate-driven effects beyond their control, while encouraging the development of climate-resilient varieties aligned with the EU’s broader sustainability objectives.

**3\.**      **Why Marketing Standards for Hemp Are Needed**

As hemp markets develop and diversify across the Union, en**suring consistent product quality, transparency, and fair competition** becomes increasingly important for the proper functioning of the internal market. Hemp and hemp-derived products circulate widely across borders and are used in a broad range of applications, from industrial processing to food and feed. In this context, the absence of a clear possibility to apply marketing standards to hemp limits the Union’s ability to address quality-related issues in a coherent and proportionate manner.

Marketing standards are a **well-established instrument** under the Common Organisation of the Markets to support market transparency, ensure a level playing field for operators, and protect the internal market from unfair practices. Extending the scope of marketing standards to hemp would not imply the automatic introduction of new requirements, but would provide the Union with the necessary legal basis to act where justified. This is particularly relevant to prevent fraudulent or non-compliant products from undermining market confidence, including in the context of imports, and to ensure that products placed on the EU market meet appropriate and consistent quality parameters.

**Conclusion**

Restoring a harmonised THC threshold of 0.5% for industrial hemp varieties, together with enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp where appropriate, represents a proportionate, evidence-based, and forward-looking policy choice. These measures would strengthen the internal market, enhance legal certainty for farmers and breeders, support innovation and climate adaptation, and restore the competitiveness of EU hemp producers, without increasing any risk of abuse or compromising public or consumer safety.

The current Commission proposals offer a timely opportunity for EU institutions to equip the hemp sector with a coherent and future-proof regulatory framework aligned with scientific evidence, historical precedent, and international best practice. The European hemp sector stands ready to contribute constructively to this process.

Annex I

**Why a THC level of 0.5% is safe and not liable for abuse**

Concerns about the potential abuse of industrial hemp must be assessed realistically, not theoretically. Abuse liability is not determined by the mere presence of THC, but by whether intoxication is practically, technically, and economically feasible.

Scientific and economic evidence shows that this is not the case for industrial hemp. Even at current THC levels, the consumption of raw hemp material cannot realistically produce intoxicating effects. The quantities required would be excessive, physically impractical to consume, and associated with severe discomfort. Processing-based scenarios, such as baking or extraction, are even less plausible. They require complex procedures, involve significant degradation of THC, and are further undermined by the presence of CBD, which may counteract THC’s psychoactive effects.

From an economic perspective, abuse is irrational. Studies analysing both end-consumer behaviour as well as hypothetical commercial misuse demonstrate that obtaining THC from industrial hemp is substantially more expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient than accessing illicit high-THC cannabis, which is already widely available on the black market. Even organised or large-scale extraction from hemp would require disproportionate amounts of biomass, advanced laboratory equipment, and specialised expertise, making it entirely unattractive from a criminal standpoint.

Crucially, raising the threshold for variety registration to 0.5% does not alter this assessment. The threshold concerns an average THC level measured in the field, subject to existing control mechanisms. It does not change the nature of the plant, nor does it enable psychoactive use. In practical terms, industrial hemp at 0.5% THC remains comparable to products such as non-alcoholic beer: it may contain trace amounts of a psychoactive substance, but without any realistic potential for intoxication.

In order to enable the misuse of industrial hemp for intoxicating purposes, the psychoactive substance delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in the plant material would have to be consumed in quantities sufficient to induce an intoxicating effect. This could theoretically occur either through direct combustion (smoking or vaping) of the plant material or through the ingestion of processed products, such as baked goods, following prior extraction of THC.

With regard to combustion, industrial hemp and illicit marijuana differ fundamentally in their THC concentration. Illicit marijuana available on the black market contains, on average, a THC content of more than 13%\[4\], \[NK1\] \[FM2\] whereas EU-certified industrial hemp contains only trace amounts of THC. To obtain a minimal intoxicating dose of approximately 15 mg of THC (an amount recognised in case law as sufficient to induce intoxication)\[5\] it would be necessary to consume several grams of industrial hemp. This would correspond to smoking more than twenty pure industrial hemp cigarettes \[NK3\] \[FM4\] within 60 minutes\[6\]. Such a consumption pattern is practically impossible, even for experienced users, due to the excessive volume of smoke, high carbon monoxide exposure, and severe irritation of the respiratory system. As a result, direct consumption through smoking or vaping does not constitute a realistic pathway for intoxication.

The baking scenario has also been examined as a theoretical form of misuse. In this case, industrial hemp flowers would first need to be processed, typically by extracting cannabinoids into a fat such as butter, which would then be incorporated into baked goods (e.g. brownies). However, this method is subject to several limiting factors. First, the amount of industrial hemp required to reach a minimal intoxicating dose would be substantial, raising questions of palatability, digestibility, and consumer acceptance. Second, the conversion of the non-psychoactive precursor THCA into psychoactive THC (decarboxylation) requires specific temperature and time conditions. During baking, the internal temperature of the product is significantly lower than the ambient oven temperature, and a considerable proportion of THCA is not converted into THC. Under typical baking conditions, more than half of the potential THC may remain unconverted\[7\].

Moreover, THC is thermally unstable and begins to degrade when exposed to excessive heat or prolonged heating, converting into cannabinol (CBN), a compound with no psychoactive effect\[8\]. This further reduces the already limited intoxicating potential of industrial hemp when processed in this manner. Additionally, industrial hemp varieties cultivated for CBD production contain significant amounts of cannabidiol (CBD), which antagonises the effects of THC at the receptor level, thereby further diminishing any psychoactive impact\[9\].

Taken together, these factors demonstrate that both combustion and baking scenarios are characterised by high material requirements, complex preparation processes, significant loss of active compounds, and unpredictable outcomes. Even under highly favourable assumptions, the resulting effects would be weak, uncertain, and substantially inferior to those obtained from illicit high-THC cannabis. Consequently, these consumption pathways do not represent a practical or realistic means of achieving intoxication using industrial hemp.

**Hemp sector suggestion for the 2028-2032 CAP:**

**0,5% THC threshold and marketing standards**

 

Executive Summary

The European hemp sector calls for the establishment of a harmonised THC threshold of 0.5% at EU level, alongside the possibility to apply marketing standards to hemp products where necessary. In the context of the revision of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the establishment of new rules for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the period 2028-2034, this paper argues that these measures are legally sound, scientifically justified, proportionate, and complementary.

A harmonized 0.5% THC threshold would **strengthen the internal market**, **ensure legal certainty** for farmers and breeders, **restore competitiveness** vis-à-vis global producers, and **reflect agronomic and climatic realities**, while posing no risk of abuse or public health harm. At the same time, enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp would provide the Union with an appropriate regulatory tool to **ensure product quality, transparency, and fair competition**, and to **protect the internal market** against fraudulent or non-compliant products, including from imports.

Taken together, these measures would allow the hemp sector to fully contribute to EU objectives under the bioeconomy, climate, and industrial policy frameworks, while ensuring a coherent, robust, and future-proof regulatory framework aligned with the principles of proportionality, market integrity, and consumer protection.

Restoring a harmonised THC threshold of 0.5% for industrial hemp varieties, together with enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp where appropriate, represents a proportionate, evidence-based, and forward-looking policy choice. These measures would strengthen the internal market, enhance legal certainty for farmers and breeders, support innovation and climate adaptation, and restore the competitiveness of EU hemp producers, without increasing any risk of abuse or compromising public or consumer safety.

The current Commission proposals offer a timely opportunity for EU institutions to equip the hemp sector with a coherent and future-proof regulatory framework aligned with scientific evidence, historical precedent, and international best practice. The European hemp sector stands ready to contribute constructively to this process.

Annex I

**Why a THC level of 0.5% is safe and not liable for abuse**

Concerns about the potential abuse of industrial hemp must be assessed realistically, not theoretically. Abuse liability is not determined by the mere presence of THC, but by whether intoxication is practically, technically, and economically feasible.

Scientific and economic evidence shows that this is not the case for industrial hemp. Even at current THC levels, the consumption of raw hemp material cannot realistically produce intoxicating effects. The quantities required would be excessive, physically impractical to consume, and associated with severe discomfort. Processing-based scenarios, such as baking or extraction, are even less plausible. They require complex procedures, involve significant degradation of THC, and are further undermined by the presence of CBD, which may counteract THC’s psychoactive effects.

From an economic perspective, abuse is irrational. Studies analysing both end-consumer behaviour as well as hypothetical commercial misuse demonstrate that obtaining THC from industrial hemp is substantially more expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient than accessing illicit high-THC cannabis, which is already widely available on the black market. Even organised or large-scale extraction from hemp would require disproportionate amounts of biomass, advanced laboratory equipment, and specialised expertise, making it entirely unattractive from a criminal standpoint.

Crucially, raising the threshold for variety registration to 0.5% does not alter this assessment. The threshold concerns an average THC level measured in the field, subject to existing control mechanisms. It does not change the nature of the plant, nor does it enable psychoactive use. In practical terms, industrial hemp at 0.5% THC remains comparable to products such as non-alcoholic beer: it may contain trace amounts of a psychoactive substance, but without any realistic potential for intoxication.

In order to enable the misuse of industrial hemp for intoxicating purposes, the psychoactive substance delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in the plant material would have to be consumed in quantities sufficient to induce an intoxicating effect. This could theoretically occur either through direct combustion (smoking or vaping) of the plant material or through the ingestion of processed products, such as baked goods, following prior extraction of THC.

With regard to combustion, industrial hemp and illicit marijuana differ fundamentally in their THC concentration. Illicit marijuana available on the black market contains, on average, a THC content of more than 13%\[4\], \[NK1\] \[FM2\] whereas EU-certified industrial hemp contains only trace amounts of THC. To obtain a minimal intoxicating dose of approximately 15 mg of THC (an amount recognised in case law as sufficient to induce intoxication)\[5\] it would be necessary to consume several grams of industrial hemp. This would correspond to smoking more than twenty pure industrial hemp cigarettes \[NK3\] \[FM4\] within 60 minutes\[6\]. Such a consumption pattern is practically impossible, even for experienced users, due to the excessive volume of smoke, high carbon monoxide exposure, and severe irritation of the respiratory system. As a result, direct consumption through smoking or vaping does not constitute a realistic pathway for intoxication.

The baking scenario has also been examined as a theoretical form of misuse. In this case, industrial hemp flowers would first need to be processed, typically by extracting cannabinoids into a fat such as butter, which would then be incorporated into baked goods (e.g. brownies). However, this method is subject to several limiting factors. First, the amount of industrial hemp required to reach a minimal intoxicating dose would be substantial, raising questions of palatability, digestibility, and consumer acceptance. Second, the conversion of the non-psychoactive precursor THCA into psychoactive THC (decarboxylation) requires specific temperature and time conditions. During baking, the internal temperature of the product is significantly lower than the ambient oven temperature, and a considerable proportion of THCA is not converted into THC. Under typical baking conditions, more than half of the potential THC may remain unconverted\[7\].

Moreover, THC is thermally unstable and begins to degrade when exposed to excessive heat or prolonged heating, converting into cannabinol (CBN), a compound with no psychoactive effect\[8\]. This further reduces the already limited intoxicating potential of industrial hemp when processed in this manner. Additionally, industrial hemp varieties cultivated for CBD production contain significant amounts of cannabidiol (CBD), which antagonises the effects of THC at the receptor level, thereby further diminishing any psychoactive impact\[9\].

Taken together, these factors demonstrate that both combustion and baking scenarios are characterised by high material requirements, complex preparation processes, significant loss of active compounds, and unpredictable outcomes. Even under highly favourable assumptions, the resulting effects would be weak, uncertain, and substantially inferior to those obtained from illicit high-THC cannabis. Consequently, these consumption pathways do not represent a practical or realistic means of achieving intoxication using industrial hemp.
