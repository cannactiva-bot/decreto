*Position Paper*

**Hemp sector suggestions for the 2028–2034 CAP / CMO revision:**

**0.5% THC threshold (baseline) + marketing standards (opt‑in), with a targeted 1.0% pathway for hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86)**

## Executive Summary

The European hemp sector calls for the establishment of a harmonised THC threshold of **0.5%** at EU level, alongside the possibility to apply marketing standards to hemp products where necessary. In the context of the revision of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the establishment of new rules for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the period **2028–2034**, this paper argues that these measures are legally sound, scientifically justified, proportionate, and complementary.

A harmonized 0.5% THC threshold would **strengthen the internal market**, **ensure legal certainty** for farmers and breeders, **restore competitiveness** vis‑à‑vis global producers, and **reflect agronomic and climatic realities**, while posing no risk of abuse or public health harm. At the same time, enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp would provide the Union with an appropriate regulatory tool to **ensure product quality, transparency, and fair competition**, and to **protect the internal market** against fraudulent or non‑compliant products, including from imports.

In parallel, the hemp sector supports a **targeted, risk‑based pathway** towards a **1.0% total THC benchmark for hemp flowers and other hemp biomass (CN 1211 90 86)**, reflecting market evolution and agronomic realities, while maintaining robust safeguards and enforcement tools. This targeted approach complements—rather than replaces—the 0.5% CAP restoration proposal.

## 1. Background and Policy Context

Industrial hemp is a versatile agricultural crop cultivated in the European Union for fibres, seeds, food, feed, and a growing range of bio‑based and innovative applications. Thanks to its low environmental footprint, its capacity to support circular value chains, and its contribution to rural development, hemp increasingly occupies a strategic position at the intersection of agricultural, environmental, climate, and industrial policy. It is explicitly recognised as a relevant crop within the Union’s bioeconomy framework and as a contributor to objectives under the European Green Deal, including climate mitigation, resource efficiency, and sustainable production.

Its regulation has historically relied on the distinction between *Cannabis sativa* L. intended for industrial purposes and cannabis varieties intended for medical or narcotic use, with the THC content of the plant consistently serving as the defining criterion for this distinction.

Since the 1980s, hemp has evolved from a largely fibre/seed crop into a diversified bioeconomy raw material, including regulated medical supply chains and industrial processing. The regulatory design should therefore distinguish between traditional fibre/seed chains and modern flower/biomass chains (CN 1211 90 86), ensuring legal certainty and proportionate risk management for each category.

## 2. Why a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold is needed (baseline)

A harmonised THC threshold is first and foremost necessary **to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market**. At present, farmers and breeders operate under a patchwork of national rules. Some Member States tolerate higher levels, others apply stricter interpretations, while countries such as Czechia allow up to 1%. Switzerland, as a European country outside the EU, also applies a THC threshold of 1%. This fragmentation undermines legal certainty and equal treatment.

The proposed threshold of 0.5% represents not an innovation, but **a restoration of a historically established and proportionate standard**. This limit was already applied in the EU under Regulation (EEC) No 2059/84 from 1984 until 1987. Its subsequent reduction was not supported by clear scientific or agronomic justification and resulted in an increasingly restrictive framework.

Furthermore, the current 0.3% threshold fails **to reflect agronomic realities**. While THC content is genetically influenced, it is also affected by environmental factors such as temperature, sunlight, soil composition, and farming practices. Even when farmers strictly comply with cultivation requirements, natural variations can lead registered varieties to marginally exceed 0.3%, exposing farmers to sanctions despite acting in good faith.

**Bridge to the 1.0% flower/biomass lane:** While a harmonised 0.5% threshold is an essential baseline for the internal market and farmer legal certainty, it does not fully address the specific realities of hemp flowers and biomass value chains. A targeted 1.0% benchmark for CN 1211 90 86 would further reduce accidental non‑compliance driven by climate variability and support innovation and competitiveness in modern hemp applications, while remaining compatible with robust safeguards.

## 3. Why Marketing Standards for Hemp Are Needed (opt‑in)

As hemp markets develop and diversify across the Union, ensuring consistent product quality, transparency, and fair competition becomes increasingly important for the proper functioning of the internal market.

Marketing standards are a well‑established instrument under the Common Organisation of the Markets to support market transparency, ensure a level playing field for operators, and protect the internal market from unfair practices. Extending the scope of marketing standards to hemp would not imply the automatic introduction of new requirements, but would provide the Union with the necessary legal basis to act where justified.

In addition, extending the legal basis for marketing standards to hemp enables **category‑specific safeguards** (e.g., for CN 1211 90 86), including traceability, batch testing, contaminants limits, and clear labelling—thereby strengthening market integrity without relying on criminal‑law ambiguity.

## Conclusion

Restoring a harmonised THC threshold of 0.5% for industrial hemp varieties, together with enabling the application of marketing standards to hemp where appropriate, represents a proportionate, evidence‑based, and forward‑looking policy choice.

In parallel, a targeted, risk‑based pathway to a 1.0% benchmark for hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86)—anchored to European technical references and coupled with safeguards—would further strengthen legal certainty for a modern hemp value chain and reduce internal market fragmentation.
