OPINION OF MR ADVOCATE GENERAL CAPOTORTI
DELIVERED ON 30 JUNE 1982 1
Mr President,
Members of the Court,
1.
The
problem
of
the
customs
treatment
to
be
accorded
to
smuggled
drugs,
which
is
the
common
subject-
matter
of
the
two
cases,
221/81
and
240/81, has recently been examined by
the Court, giving rise to the judgment of
5 February 1981 in Case 50/80, Horváth
v
Hauptzollamt
Hamburg-Jonas
[1981]
ECR 385. In that judgment it was stated
that "the introduction
of the
Common
Customs
Tariff
no
longer
leaves
a
Member
State
the
power
to
apply
customs duties to drugs which have been
smuggled in and
destroyed
as soon
as
they were discovered but does leave it
full freedom to take criminal proceedings
in respect of offences committed, with all
the
attendant
consequences,
including
fines".
The questions raised in these two cases
call for
development
and expansion
of
the previous analysis of the Community
customs tariff rules (and in particular the
provisions of Article 9 (1) and Articles 18
to
29
of
the
EEC
Treaty).
The
fundamental
point
to
be
established
is
1 — Translated from the Italian.

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
whether
the
discovery
and
subsequent
destruction
of
the
smuggled
drugs
are
essential pre-conditions for the negation
of
the
individual
Member
States'
authority to levy customs duties and in
particular whether when drugs smuggled
into the territory of a Member State are
re-exported that authority is also to be
regarded as negated.
Let me briefly
summarize
the
facts
of
each case.
A — On
26 April
1976 Wilfried
Wolf
was
sentenced
by
the
Landgericht
[Regional
Court]
Düsseldorf
to
eight
years'
imprisonment
for
wilful
and
continued
infringement
of
the
German
Law on drugs. The court had found that
between July and October
1975 he had
been
a party to the distribution of 742
grams
of
heroin
and
150
grams
of
cocaine, having obtained the drugs
not
only by purchasing them in Germany but
also — in one instance — by personally
importing
them
from
the
Netherlands.
On the basis of the facts set out in the
above-mentioned
judgment
in
criminal
proceedings, the Hauptzollamt [Principal
Customs Office] Düsseldorf (by a notice
dated 3 December 1976, which was sub­
sequently
amended)
declared
that
Mr
Wolf was liable to duty because he had
failed
to declare the imported drugs to
the
customs
authorities
and
had
purchased
imported
goods
after
the
customs debt had arisen but before it was
discharged.
The
value
for
customs
purposes of the goods in question
was
determined as DM 74 200 for the heroin
and DM 15 000 for the cocaine.
Mr
Wolf,
after
unsuccessfully
lodging
an
objection
through
administrative
channels against the assessment of duty,
brought
an
appeal
before
the
Finanz-
gericht
(Finance
Court)
Düsseldorf,
which by order of 10 June
1981 stayed
the
proceedings
in
order
to
refer
the
following questions to this Court for a
preliminary ruling:
" 1 . Are
the
provisions
of
the
EEC
Treaty
on
the
customs
union
(Articles 9 (1) and
12 to 29) to be
interpreted as meaning that since the
introduction
of
the
Common
Customs Tariff
a Member State has
no longer
been
authorized
to
levy
customs
duties
on
smuggled
drugs
which
in
the
event
of
discovery
would
have to
be
confiscated
and
destroyed?
2. If
the
answer
to
the
aforesaid
question
is
in
the
negative
and
customs duties are to be levied, the
preliminary
questions
set
forth
by
the
Finanzgericht
Hamburg,
in
its
order
of
15 January
1980 —
IV
89/78 H — making a reference for a
preliminary ruling in Case 50/80, are
submitted in the alternative."
B — The
Landgericht
Freiburg
sen­
tenced Senta Einberger on 27 July 1977
to one year's imprisonment, likewise for
infringement
of
the
German
Law
on
drugs. The
offence
committed
by
Mrs
Einberger
consisted
of
travelling
on
several
occasions
between
Spring
and
Autumn 1974 from the Federal Republic
of Germany to Switzerland
and
selling
there, at various times and in quantities
varying between 30 and 100 grams, 280
grams of morphine previously
imported
into the
Federal
Republic of
Germany
without authority and without
payment
of import duties. Having regard to the
above-mentioned
judgment
in
criminal
proceedings, the Hauptzollamt
Freiburg
issued a notice of assessment against Mrs
Einberger on 19 January 1978 for import
duties totalling DM 10 960.36.
Mrs
Einberger,
after
unsuccessfully
lodging
an
objection
through
adminis­
trative channels, brought
a legal action
against
the
Hauptzollamt
before
the
3693

## Page 3

OPINION OF MR CAPOTORTI — CASE 221/81
Finanzgericht
Baden-Württemberg
for
annulment of the notice of
assessment.
By order dated 16 June 1981 the Finanz­
gericht stayed the proceedings in order
to refer to this Court, pursuant to Article
177 of
the EEC Treaty,
the
following
question: "Since the introduction of the
Common Customs Tariff, has a Member
State been authorized to charge customs
duties
on
drugs
which
have
been
smuggled into and subsequently removed
from
the
customs
territory
of
the
Community?"
By order of 3 February 1982 the Court
ordered that the two cases be joined for
the
purpose
of
the
oral
procedure,
in
view of their related subject-matter.
2.
The questions submitted by the two
German courts essentially seek from the
Court
an interpretation
of the
Horvath
judgment,
to
which
I
referred
at
the
beginning of this opinion. The
Finanz­
gericht
Düsseldorf,
implicitly taking
as
the
point
of
departure
the
principle
enunciated in the Horvath case — that is
to say that customs duties may not be
levied
on
smuggled
drugs
which
have
been discovered and destroyed — raised
the question whether the mere import­
ation of contraband, without subsequent
discovery and destruction, would
result
in the duties' not being payable if it were
provided by law that smuggled drugs, if
discovered,
must
be
seized
and
destroyed. For its part, the Finanzgericht
Baden-Württemberg
adopted
the
same
approach,
raising the question
whether
the
importation
of
contraband
is
sufficient
to
preclude
the
levying
of
customs duties even where the drug has
subsequently been re-exported from
the
Community.
In those circumstances, it seems to
me
that the question raised by the Finanz­
gericht
Düsseldorf
covers
the
other
question: If in fact the answer given is
that actual seizure and destruction of the
drugs are not essential pre-conditions for
non-application
of
the
Customs
Tariff
and that such a result is on the contrary
brought about by the mere fact of
the
importation
of
contraband
(account
being taken of
the
existence of
a rule
which requires seizure and destruction of
the drug), the question submitted by the
Finanzgericht
Baden-Württemberg
is
thereby answered, without the need for a
more
detailed
examination
of
the
circumstances
of
the
re-exportation,
which
needless
to
say
followed
the
smuggling of the drug into the territory
of the Community.
3.
It seems to me that a careful analysis
must be made of the Horvath judgment,
not
merely
because
the
courts
which
submitted
the
questions
took
it
into
consideration,
but
because
it
clearly
represents
the
fundamental
point
of
reference.
I
shall
confine
myself
to
pointing
out,
in that
respect,
that
the
decision contained in that judgment is a
considered
decision
the
grounds
of
which are adequately stated — the fact
that it differs
from
my opinion
of
27
November
1980 [1981] ECR 399)
does
not induce me to re-expound the view
which I thought preferable but rather to
endeavour to understand
and to
clarify
fully the reasoning underlying the view
adopted by the Court.
Certainly, a reading of the operative part
alone (to which I have referred
above)
might
lead
to
the
inference
that
the
discovery and immediate destruction of
the
smuggled
drugs
are
essential
pre­
conditions
for
the
non-applicability
of
customs
duties.
In
that
regard
the
3694

## Page 4

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
Finanzgericht
Düsseldorf
rightly
observed that, if such
an
interpretation
of the Community rules relating to the
Common Customs Tariff were adopted,
the
result would
be
that
the
question
whether
or
not
customs
duties
were
payable
would
depend
upon
an
absolutely accidental event, such as the
discovery or
otherwise
by the
customs
authorities of the smuggled
goods. But
that interpretation cannot be upheld. The
grounds of the Horváth judgment show
that the Court referred
in the operative
part to the destruction
of drugs which
had been imported and discovered only
because
those
were
the
facts
of
that
specific case and that in reality the Court
intended to express a view the scope of
which
was
different
and
more
far-
reaching.
In that regard, clarification
is provided
by
paragraph
11
of
the
decision,
in
which
it
is
stated
that
where
the
Common
Customs
Tariff
includes
a
narcotic substance (heroin in that case)
"it
can
only
apply
to
imports
of
the
product which are intended for an auth­
orized
use". The
reasons
for
that
in­
terpretation
are
given
immediately
afterwards:
"Ad
valorem
customs
duty
cannot be determined for goods which
are of such a kind that they may not be
put into circulation in any Member State
but must on the contrary be seized and
taken
out
of
circulation
by
the
competent authorities as soon as they are
discovered."
It
is clear
therefore
that,
according to the rationale of the Horváth
judgment, the inapplicability of customs
duties is not dependent upon
discovery
and destruction of the drugs but rather
upon
the
fact
that,
in
view
of
the
harmful
character
and
the
intended
unlawful
use of the products, they may
not be imported into the Member States
and put into commercial circulation (see
also in that connection paragraphs 9 and
12 of the decision).
4.
The fact that that is the real meaning
of the Horváth judgment is confirmed by
the rules referred
to in it and
by
the
manner
in which
they
are
interpreted.
Paragraph
13 of the decision
refers
to
Article 18 of the EEC Treaty, that is to
say to the rule which is at the beginning
of the section devoted to the "Setting up
of
the
Common
Customs
Tariff",
in
which "the Member States declare their
readiness
to
contribute
to
the
development of international
trade
and
the
lowering
of
barriers
to
trade
by
entering
into
agreements
designed,
on
a
basis
of
reciprocity
and
mutual
advantage,
to
reduce
customs
duties
below the general
level of which
they
could avail themselves as a rësuttTöf the
establishment
of
a
customs
union
between them". In that respect the Court
observes: "Since Article 18 of the EEC
Treaty indicates that the setting up of the
Common
Customs Tariff
is
seen
as
a
contribution to the devélöpTïïeïïröf inter­
national
trade
and
the
lowering
of
barriers to trade, it cannot relate to the
importation
of
narcotics
which
are
intended
for
unlawful
use
and
are
withdrawn
from
circulation
as soon
as
they are discovered." To the same effect,
reference might also be made — as was
indeed made by the representative of the
Commission
during the oral
procedure
—
to
Article
29
of
the
EEC
Treaty
which
mentions,
among
the
general
criteria by which the Commission should
be guided
in carrying
out
its tasks in
connection with the Common
Customs
Tariff,
a number of
factors
which
are
certainly
incompatible
with
the
application
of
the
tariff
to
drugs
intended
for
unlawful
purposes:
the
"need
to
promote
trade
between
3695

OPINION OF MR CAPOTORTI — CASE 221/81
Member
States
and
third
countries"
(subparagraph (a)); the "developments in
conditions
of
competition
within
the
Community"
(subparagraph
(b));
the
"requirements
of
the
Community
as
regards the supply of raw materials and
semi-finished goods" (subparagraph (c));
and
the "need
to avoid serious
distur­
bances in the economies of the Member
States
and
to
ensure
rational
develop­
ment of production and an expansion of
consumption
within
the
Community"
(subparagraph (d)).
The Horvath judgment also referred
to
Regulation No 803/68 of the Council on
the
valuation
of
goods
for
customs
purposes,
noting
that
the
provisions
thereof
"are
based
on
the
assumption
that the imported goods are capable of
being put on the market
and
absorbed
into commercial circulation" (paragraph
12 of the decision). It seems to me that
this is the most significant passage of the
decision. For my part, I would point out
that the sixth recital in the preamble to
Regulation No 803/68 confirms the view
that its provisions apply only to
goods
which may be put on the market. It is in
fact
stated in that recital that
uniform
determination of the value for
customs
purposes must serve inter alia to prevent
"any
deflection
of
trade
and
activities
and any distortion of competition which
might
arise
from
differences
between
national provisions"; and it seems to me
that it is incontestable that that purpose
cannot be achieved in the case of goods
which, like drugs, may not be imported
or
traded
in
(with
the
exception
of
course
of
"trade
which
is
strictly
controlled and limited to authorized use
for
pharmaceutical
and
medical
pur­
poses", see paragraph 10 of the decision,
infine).
Finally, the Court referred to Articles 10
and
11
of
Council
Regulation
No
1430/79
of
2
July
1979
on
the
repayment
or
remission
of
import
or
export duties. Although not applicable to
the present
cases
ratione temporis, that
regulation
nevertheless
provides
useful
criteria
for
the
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
Treaty
relating
to
customs
tariffs.
According
to
those
articles, "import duties must be repaid or
remitted where goods subject to payment
of such duties are destroyed under the
supervision of the competent authorities"
(paragraph 14 of the decision); it may be
inferred therefrom
that the existence of
the liability to pay duties is
connected
with the possibility of the goods' being
placed
in
circulation.
In
the
same
context, reference may also be made to
Article-
2
of
Council
Directive
797623/EEC
of -25 June
1979
on
the
harmonization
of provisions laid
down
by
law,
regulation
or
administrative
action
relating
to
customs
debt;
as
was
observed
by
the
Finanzgericht
Düsseldorf,
a
customs
debt
arises
by
virtue of that provision when goods are
cleared through
customs in the
normal
way (see paragraph (a)) and in a number
of
cases,
listed
exhaustively,
of
infringement
of
specific
customs
rules
(see paragraphs
(b) to (f)), but it does
not provide that a customs debt arises in
the case of goods whose importation is
absolutely forbidden,
as in the
case of
drugs
not
intended
for
pharmaceutical
use.
5.
In the
course of
these
proceedings
mention has also been made, in support
of
the
interpretation
of
the
Common
Customs Tariff
upheld
in the
Horváth
3696


---

## Page 6

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
judgment, of the consideration that it is
very difficult to prove what quantity of
drugs has been smuggled when it has not
been
possible
physically
to
locate
and
confiscate
them;
in
consequence,
it
is
impossible to determine the total value
for
customs
purposes
of
the
smuggled
goods in order to determine the duty to
be
levied
on
them. I do
not
however
think that such an argument is relevant
or that it is necessary. In the first place, I
doubt whether reasons of mere practical
expediency should be used as a basis to
establish the scope of a legal provision; it
has
been
seen
that
the
scope
of
such
provisions is based rather on a matter of
principle, namely the function
attributed
to the Common
Customs Tariff
in the
context
of economic integration
within
the
Community.
Moreover,
the
difficulties
of proof
referred
to do not
appear to constitute
an
insurmountable
obstacle to the levying of duties. In cases
where
the
quantity
of
the
goods
imported cannot be reliably established,
the
customs
authorities
often
have
recourse
to
inductive
methods
of
assessment.
6.
It is therefore essentially on the basis
of the reasoning set out in the
Horvath
judgment
(supplemented
by
further
argument to the same effect, to which I
have drawn
attention)
that
the
present
two cases may be settled. The Court will
be acting in a manner consistent with the
views which it has expressed in the past
if it holds that the import of smuggled
drugs is not subject to customs duties,
regardless
of
whether
the
drugs
are
discovered and destroyed or re-exported.
Of course, it is also possible for drugs to
be
imported
lawfully,
and
indeed
the
Common Customs Tariff
includes a list
of drugs and specifies the duties payable
on
them;
the
imports
concerned
are
those
made
within
the
framework
of
"trade
which
is strictly controlled
and
limited
to
authorized
use for
pharma­
ceutical
and
medical
purposes"
(see
paragraph
10
of
the
decision
in
the
Horváth case cited above).
In
view
of
the
foregoing,
it
may
be
stated in general terms that the question
whether any customs debt arises in the
case
of
the
import
of
drugs
depends
upon the purpose for which the goods
are
intended
and
upon
whether
the
import
is
open
or
clandestine.
The
objection
may
be
raised
that
an
importer's proposed use of the drug is a
subjective
factor,
at
variance
with
the
need for certainty in customs regulations.
The obvious reply seems to me however
to be that a clandestine import may be
presumed to be intended for an unlawful
use, whereas an open import, even one
which
is
in
some
way
irregular
(for
example where one of the required auth­
orizations has not been obtained), gives
rise to the obligation to pay duty, if the
purpose
declared
by
the
importer
is
lawful.
Finally,
it
may
be
asked
what
justi­
fication there is for the different customs
treatment accorded to drugs as opposed
to
other
smuggled
goods
(spirits,
cigarettes,
arms)
in
respect
of
which
there is no doubt that the customs debt
arises and must be discharged when the
import is discovered by the authorities.
In my opinion, the justification
may lie
in
the
fact
that,
in
contrast
to
other
goods,
nearly
all
traffic
in
drugs
is
contraband
and
is
intended
for
an
3697

OPINION OF MR CAPOTORTI — CASE 221/81
unlawful use, so that for them to be put
into
commercial
circulation
may
be
regarded
as
an
exceptional
event
of
minor
importance.
Moreover,
once
smuggled
drugs
are
discovered
and
seized
it
is
normal
for
them
to
be
destroyed; on the other hand, in those
rare
cases
where
the
administration
decides to sell them to a pharmaceutical
undertaking, it certainly appears lawful
— as far as the Common Customs Tariff
is
concerned
—
that
the
purchaser
should be asked to pay the prescribed
duty for properly effected
imports. In
any
case,
the
interpretation
of
the
customs rules given by the Court with
reference to drugs is specific in character
and
must
not
be
extended
to
other
products which may also be imported
and
released
for
consumption
only
within the framework
of
a system of
authorizations and checks.
7.
In view of all the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court, in
answer to the first question submitted by the Finanzgericht Düsseldorf by
order of
10 June
1981 in Case 221/81,
Wolf
v Hauptzollamt
Düsseldorf,
should rule as follows: "The provisions of the EEC Treaty relating to the
customs union (Article 9 (1) and Articles 18 to 29) must be interpreted as
meaning
that
after
the
introduction
of
the
Common
Customs Tariff
a
Member State is no longer authorized to levy customs duties on drugs in so
far as the import and marketing thereof are prohibited". It is to be noted that
the Finanzgericht's second question was submitted in the alternative in the
event of a negative reply to the main question. Therefore, since the reply
which I suggest
is affirmative,
there
is no need to
consider
the
second
question.
As regards the question submitted by the Finanzgericht Baden-Württemberg
by order of 16 June 1981 in Case 240/81 Einberger
vHauptzollamt Freiburg,
I am of the opinion that the reply should be worded exactly as set out above,
with the following addition: "Customs duties may not therefore be levied,
even
where
the
smuggled
drugs
are
subsequently
re-exported
from
the
Community customs territory".
