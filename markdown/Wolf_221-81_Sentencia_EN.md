JUDGMENT OF 26. 10. 1982 — CASE 221/81
on the interpretation of the Community provisions on the customs union in
connection with the unlawful importation of drugs,

of
Chambers),

JUDGMENT
Facts and Issues
The
facts
of
the
case, the
course of
the
procedure
and
the
observations
submitted pursuant to Article 20 of the
Protocol on the Statute of the Court of
Justice of the EEC may be summarized
as follows:
I — Facts and procedure
1.
By a final judgment of the Land­
gericht [Regional Court] Düsseldorf of
26.
April
1976,
Wilfried
Wolf,
the
plaintiff
in
the
main
action,
was
committed
to
prison
for
8 years
for
unlawfully trafficking in drugs.
According to the findings of the Land­
gericht,
Mr Wolf
had
operated
as a
"dealer" in the old quarter of Düsseldorf
from mid-July 1965 until his arrest about
mid-October
1975. Mr Wolf had been
involved in the sale of 742 grammes of
heroin
and
150
grammes
of
cocaine,
most
of
which
he
had
obtained
in
Düsseldorf and various other towns, the
remainder having been imported, by him
from the Netherlands.
On the basis of Article 57 (2) of the
Customs Law (Zollgesetz), the Haupt-
zollamt Düsseldorf, the defendant in the
main action, considered that the plaintiff
should
pay
import
duties
on
the
quantities of
drugs referred
to in the
judgment of the Landgericht, on the one
hand
because
he
had
not
himself
declared
imported
goods
which
were
subject to customs control and therefore
was the first person to have concealed
them from the customs authorities and,
on
the
other
hand,
because
he
had
purchased
imported
goods
subject
to
customs control after the liability to pay
customs duties had arisen and before it
had been extinguished, whilst he knew,
or should have known, that the goods in
question were subject to customs control.

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
By notice of assessment of 3 December
1976, amended on 28 January 1977, the
Hauptzollamt claimed payment of those
duties
from
the plaintiff. Taking
as
a
basis
the
purchase
price
paid
by
the
plaintiff, the Hauptzollamt estimated the
dutiable value
of
the
742
grammes
of
heroin
at DM
74 200
and
of
the
150
grammes of cocaine at DM 15 000.
The objection lodged by the plaintiff in
the
main
action
against
the
notice
of
assessment
was
dismissed
and
he
ap­
pealed to the Finanzgericht Düsseldorf.
2.
Referring
to
the
judgment
of
the
Court of 5 February 1981 in Case 50/80
Horvath
[1981] ECR
385, the
Finanz­
gericht Düsseldorf,
by order of 10 June
1981,
decided
to
stay
the
proceedings
and requested the Court to give a ruling
on the following questions:
" 1 . Are
the
provisions
of
the
EEC
Treaty
on
the
customs
union
(Articles 9 (1) and
12 to 29) to be
interpreted as meaning that since the
introduction
of
the
Common
Customs Tariff
a Member State has
no longer
been
authorized
to levy
customs
duties
on
smuggled
drugs
which
in
the
event
of
discovery
would
have to
be
confiscated
and
destroyed?
2. If
the
answer
to
the
aforesaid
question
is
in
the
negative
and
customs duties are to be levied, the
preliminary
questions
set
forth
by
the
Finanzgericht
[Finance
Court]
Hamburg, in its order of 15 January
1980 — IV
89/78H
—
making
a
reference for a preliminary ruling in
Case
50/80
are
submitted
in
the
alternative."
3.
In the statement of grounds of the
order making the reference, the Finanz-
gericht mentions that in the judgment of
5 February
1981 cited above the Court
held
that
"the
introduction
of
the
Common
Customs
Tariff
no
longer
leaves
a
Member
State
the
power
to
apply
customs
duties
to
drugs
which
have been smuggled in and destroyed as
soon as they were discovered but it does
leave it full
freedom
to
take
criminal
proceedings
in
respect
of
offences
committed,
with
all
the
attendant
consequences, including fines".
The
Finanzgericht
wishes
to
know
whether the principle enunciated in that
judgment extends also to those cases in
which
the
smuggled
drugs
were
not
discovered
and
could
not therefore
be
confiscated and destroyed. It is not clear
from
the
grounds
of
the
judgment
whether, and if so for what reason, the
confiscation
and
destruction
constitute
one of the factors on which the solution
adopted
was
based
or
whether
such
circumstances
represent
merely
one
possible
factual
variation
to which
the
principle
enunciated
applies.
In
that
respect, the Finanzgericht points out that
if
confiscation
and
destruction
are
of
decisive
importance,
the
question
of
when
the
customs
duties
become
payable, and by whom, would often
be
decided by chance.
The Finanzgericht then points out
that
Regulation No 803/68 of the Council of
27 June 1968 on the valuation of goods
for
customs purposes
(Official
Journal,
English Special Edition, 1968 (I), p. 170)
relates only to normal trade. Moreover,
the recitals in the preamble to Council
Directive 79/623 of 25 June 1979 on the
harmonization
of
provisions
laid
down
by
law,
regulation
or
administrative
action relating to customs debt
(Official
Journal
1979,
L
179,
p.
31),
clearly
indicate
that
a
customs
debt
is of
an
economic nature and does not serve the
aims
of
criminal
law.
The
absolute
prohibition of the importation of drugs
therefore
falls
outside
the
scope
of
customs
law
and
the powers
to
adopt
rules thereunder.
In the event of
a negative reply to the
first question, the first questions referred
to
the
Court
by
the
Finanzgericht
Hamburg in its order of 15 January 1980
3683

## Page 4

JUDGMENT OF 26. 10. 1982 — CASE 221/81
in
Case
50/80
cited
above
become
important
to
determine
the
value
for
customs purposes of the smuggled drugs.
Those questions are worded as follows :
" 1 . Are
the
provisions
of
Regulation
(EEC) No 803/68 of the Council of
27
June
1968
and
of
Regulation
(EEC)
No
603/72
of
the
Commission of 24 March 1972 to be
interpreted as meaning that, with the
exception of those provisions which
require
goods
subject
to
customs
control
to
be
formally
presented,
they
also
apply
directly
to
the
valuation
for
customs
purposes
of
goods
smuggled
into
the
customs
territory of the Community?
2. Are
the
provisions
of
Regulation
(EEC) No
803/68 of
the
Council,
especially Articles 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8
thereof, to be interpreted as meaning
that the value for customs purposes
of
the
goods
smuggled
into
the
customs territory of the Community
is fixed with reference
to the time
and place of their introduction into
the
customs
territory
of
the
Community, even if according to the
national substantive legal provisions
from
time
to
time
applicable
the
liability
to
the
customs
arises
at
another
time
and
is payable
by
a
person
other
than
the
first
buyer
residing in Community territory?
3. Are
the
provisions
of
Regulation
(EEC)
No
375/69
of
the
Commission
of
27
February
1969
and
of
Regulation
(EEC)
No
1343/75
of
the
Commission
of
26
May
1975
to
be
interpreted
as
meaning that they apply also in the
event of goods being smuggled into
the
customs
territory
of
the
Community
with
the
attendant
condition that any buyer subsequent
to the first residing in that territory
who is found to be in possession of
the
smuggled
goods
has to
supply
particulars of the price which he has
paid so that the price paid by that
person
is
the
relevant
value
for
customs
purposes,
or
do
the
competent national authorities, have
to take the purchase price paid by
the
first
buyer
residing
in
Community territory as the basis of
the value of the smuggled goods for
customs purposes in accordance with
the rules laid down in Articles 1, 2,
4, 6, 7 and 9 of Regulation
(EEC)
No 803/68?"
4.
The order making the reference was
received at the Court Registry on 22 July
1981.
Pursuant to Article 20 of the Protocol on
the Statute of the Court of Justice of the
EEC,
written
observations
were
sub­
mitted by the Government of the French
Republic,
represented
by
Maryse
Aulagnon,
a member of the
Secretariat
General
of
the
Inter-Departmental
Committee
for
Questions
of
European
Economic Cooperation
attached
to
the
Prime
Minister's
Office
and
by
the
Commission of the European Communi­
ties, represented by its legal adviser, Rolf
Wägenbaur, acting as Agent.
By order of 3 Februay 1982, the Court
decided
to
join
Cases
221/81
and
240/81
for
the
purpose
of
the
oral
procedure.
On
hearing
the
report
of
the
Judge-
Rapporteur
and
the
views
of
the
Advocate General, the Court decided to
open
the
oral
procedure
without
any
preparatory inquiry. However, it invited
the
Commission
to
provide
the
Court
with a description of the laws and regu­
lations and customs practices governing,
in each of the Member States,
On the one hand, the illegal importation
of drugs the use and marketing of which
are
strictly
forbidden
within
their
territory; and,
3684


---

## Page 5

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
On the other hand, the illegal import­
ation of products the marketing of which
is not prohibited as such within national
territory
but
which
are
or
have
been
smuggled into that territory.
The
information
collected
by
the
Commission
from
the
Member
States
may be summarized as follows:
The illegal importation of drugs the use
and
marketing
of
which
are
strictly
prohibited
gives rise to liability to
pay
customs duties and the levying of import
duties in Belgium. Such imports give rise
to liability to pay customs duties in the
Federal
Republic
of
Germany,
Ireland
und the Netherlands.
However,
in
the
Federal
Republic
of
Germany,
since
the
judgment
of
the
Court of 5 February 1981 in Case 50/80
cited above, import duties are not levied
after discovery of the drugs in the event
of
their
destruction,
and
there
is
moreover a presumption that they have
been destroyed. In Ireland, the liability
to
pay
customs
duties
is
regarded
as
extinguished
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
unlawfully
imported
drugs
are
confiscated
and
destroyed.
In
the
Netherlands,
import
duties
are
levied
where
the
drugs
have
been
consumed
and
the
illegal
importation
can
be
proved, but they
are not
levied
in
the
event of confiscation and destruction.
In Italy, the illegal importation of drugs
gives
rise
to
liability
to
pay
customs
duties, except in the case of re-export or
destruction by official order.
The illegal importation of drugs does not
give rise to any liability to pay customs
duties in Greece or Luxembourg, where
drugs
which
are
discovered
are
confiscated
and
destroyed.
In
Luxem­
bourg, however, liability to pay customs
duties
arises
if
the
drugs
have
been
consumed.
Finally, the illegal importation of drugs
does not give rise to the levying of duties
in
Denmark,
France
or
the
United
Kingdom. However, in France, in those
cases where illegally imported drugs are
not destroyed by official
order but
are
sold, for
example
to
approved
labora­
tories, duties are levied upon such sale.
In the United Kingdom, duties are not
levied in any case, regardless of whether
the offending
importer sold,
consumed
or re-exported the drugs.
The illegal importation of products
the
marketing
of
which
is
not
per
se
prohibited
gives rise to liability to
pay
customs duties in all the Member States,
except
in
Greece
where
illegally
imported goods are confiscated.
However, import duties are not levied in
Denmark in those cases where the party
liable
to
duty
is
unknown
and
the
products are destroyed or sold.
In Ireland, import duties are regarded as
having
been
paid
where
a
smuggled
product
is
returned
to
the
person
concerned
against
payment
of
a
sum
determined by arrangement and in cases
where
the
product
is
confiscated
and
subsequently sold; on the other hand, the
liability to pay customs duties is regarded
as
extinguished
if
the
products
are
destroyed
by
official
order
or
re­
exported.
In Luxembourg, products smuggled into
the country are as a rule confiscated and
sold. Import duties are levied upon
the
sale if the products are sold with a view
to
consumption
within
the
country;
duties are also levied where the products
in question have been consumed.
In the United Kingdom, duties are not
levied when the products are confiscated
3685

JUDGMENT OF 26. 10. 1982 — CASE 221/81
unless they are returned to the importer
or sold by official
order. On the other
hand, duties are levied in the case of sale
or re-export by the importer.
II
—
Summary
of
the
written
observations
submitted
to
the Court
The
Government
of the French Republic
points
out
that
the
first
question
submitted by the Finanzgericht raises the
problem of the customs regime applied
to
drugs
whose
use
is prohibited
but
which have been sold in a Member State
in circumstances where, in the absence of
any
confiscation,
their
existence
could
not
be established. In the light of
the
judgment
of
the
Court
of
5
February
1981 in Case 50/80 Horvath [1981] ECR
385
the
question
to
be
answered
is
whether the confiscation and destruction
of the products concerned
are likely to
be
a
factor
giving
rise
to
the
non-
collection
of
customs
duties
and
whether,
in
consequence,
the
unlawful
distribution
of undiscovered
drugs
may
call for a different course of action.
The French Government notes that the
terms
of
the
operative
part
("drugs
which
have
been
smuggled
in
and
destroyed
as
soon
as
they
were
discovered")
and
certain
paragraphs
in
the statement of grounds of the above-
mentioned judgment appear to establish
a link between the unlawfulness
of the
use
of
the
imported
product
and
its
destruction. It considers however that the
Court established that link merely with a
view
to
making
a
general
statement
based restrictively on the actual facts of
the case.
In effect,
the operative part sums up a
series of arguments according to which
the destruction of smuggled drugs could
not be regarded
as a pre-condition
for
the applicability of
the
Common
Cus­
toms Tariff. As the Court
emphasized,
that
inapplicability
is
based
on
the
unlawfulness
of the use of drugs
("the
. . . question ... is not concerned simply
with the case of the illegal importation of
any product but concerns the smuggling
of a harmful
substance intended for
an
unlawful
use, which
was
destroyed
as
soon as it was discovered" — paragraph
9 of the decision in the judgment cited
above).
In that respect, the French
Government
also refers to paragraphs 11 to 14 of the
decision, from which it appears that the
Community
provisions
on
customs
matters
cannot
be
applied
to
products
the use of which is authorized and which
are "capable of being part of the market
and
absorbed
into
commercial
circu­
lation" (paragraph 12).
That view is in harmony with the French
legislation
which
makes
no
distinction
between
a
case
where
drugs
are
unlawfully
imported,
seized
and
destroyed (Case 50/80) and the present
case in which drugs were sold. With the
exception of
a number of specific
uses
subject to close State supervision, the use
of drugs on French territory is absolutely
prohibited. Consequently, no liability to
pay
customs
duties
can
arise
and
im­
portation cannot give rise to the payment
of duties.
3686

## Page 7

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
Moreover,
the
French
Government
aligns
itself
with
the
arguments
put
forward
by
the
court
making
the
reference,
and concludes that since the
introduction
of
the
Common
Customs
Tariff
a
Member
State
no
longer
has
authority to levy customs duties on drugs
which are smuggled into a country and
put to uses in respect of which no lawful
trade
exists
and
which,
if
discovered,
must be confiscated and destroyed.
The
Commission
of
the
European
Communities states that in its opinion the
decisive criterion to be inferred from the
Horvath judgment cited above regarding
the
applicability
of
the
Common
Customs Tariff
is whether
or
not
the
goods in question are of a kind capable
of
being
absorbed
into
circulation
(paragraph
11). In
the
case
of
drugs,
such as heroin and cocaine, importation
and marketing are prohibited in all the
Member States (paragraph
10). The fact
that
the
products
must
be
seized
and
taken
out
of
circulation
is merely
the
legal
consequence
to
be
inferred
from
the
prohibition
of
putting
them
into
circulation.
That point of view is confirmed by the
fact that the other grounds stated by the
Court in relation to drugs smuggled into
a country and destroyed upon discovery
remain
valid
where,
because
of
the
circumstances, destruction
is out of the
question.
The Commission also refers in particular
to the recitals in the preamble to Council
Directive 79/623 of 25 June 1979 on the
harmonization
of provisions
laid
down
by
law,
regulation
or
administrative
action relating to customs debt
(Official
Journal
1979, L 179, p. 31), and draws
attention
to
the
essentially
economic
nature
of
import
and
export
duties.
Moreover,
Article
2
of
that
directive
provides that a customs debt arises in the
normal case of customs clearance and in
the restrictively listed cases of failure to
comply with customs requirements in the
narrow
sense,
such
as
infringement
of
Community
provisions
regarding
customs
procedures
or
the
removal
of
goods
liable
to
import
duty
from
the
customs
supervision
involved
in
the
temporary
storage
of
goods.
On
the
other hand, there is no provision in the
directive giving rise to any liability to pay
customs duties in a case where there is
an absolute prohibition on importation.
The Commission therefore proposes that
the first question should be answered in
the
affirmative.
It
emphasizes
however
that its analysis applies solely to the case
of
drugs
the
circulation
of
which
is
strictly
prohibited.
Consequently,
its
conclusion
is without
prejudice
to
the
more
general
case
of
the
import
of
goods
in
breach
of
a
prohibition
on
importation,
such
as
for
example
the
importation of handguns in baggage.

JUDGMENT OF 26. 10. 1982 — CASE 221/81
Decision
1
By order of 10 June 1981, received at the Court on 22 July 1981, the Finanz­
gericht [Finance Court] Düsseldorf referred to the Court for a preliminary
ruling under Article 177 of the EEC Treaty a number of questions on the
application of the Common Customs Tariff to smuggled drugs.
2
The
dispute in the main proceedings
concerns
the determination
of
the
custom duties applicable to quantities of heroin
and cocaine which were
purchased by the plaintiff in the main proceedings on the black market in
Germany and the Netherlands and re-sold by him in contravention of the
Betäubungsmittelgesetz
[German Drugs Law]. For those offences
he was
sentenced by a German criminal court to eight years' imprisonment.
3
It is pointed out in the order for reference that, in its judgment of 5 February
1981 in Case 50/80 Horváth [1981] ECR 385, the Court stated that the
introduction of the Common Customs Tariff no longer left a Member State
the power to apply customs duties to drugs which had been smuggled in and
destroyed as soon as they had been discovered but did leave it full freedom
to take criminal proceedings in respect of offences committed.
4
Since in the present
case the
smuggled
drugs were
not
discovered
and
therefore
could not be seized and destroyed, the Finanzgericht has asked
whether in its above-mentioned judgment the Court, in referring to destruc­
tion of the drugs, regarded such destruction as an essential pre-condition for
the solution
adopted. It
adds
that, if
such were
the
case, the
question
whether a customs debt arose would often depend on the mere chance of
discovery.
5
In those circumstances, the national court has submitted various questions
for a preliminary ruling, the first being as follows:
"Are the provisions of the EEC Treaty on the customs union (Articles 9 (1)
and 12 to 29) to be interpreted as meaning that since the introduction of the
Common Customs Tariff a Member State has no longer been authorized to
levy customs duties on smuggled
drugs which in the event of
discovery
would have to be confiscated and destroyed?"
3688

WOLF v HAUPTZOLLAMT DÜSSELDORF
6
Before that question
is dealt with, it is appropriate to consider the pre­
liminary question whether the unlawful importation into the Community of
illegally marketed drugs gives rise to a customs debt.
7
So phrased, the question
does not concern the problem of the
unlawful
importation of products in general but that of the unlawful importation of
drugs.
8
As the Court pointed out in the Horváth judgment cited above, drugs such as
morphine, heroin and cocaine display special features in so far as their harm-
fulness
is generally recognized
and their importation
and
marketing
are
prohibited
in
all
the
Member
States,
except
in
trade
which
is
strictly
controlled
and limited to authorized
use for pharmaceutical
and
medical
purposes.
9
This legal position is in conformity with the Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs, 1961, (United Nations Treaty Series 520, No 7515), to which all the
Member States are now parties. In the preamble to that Convention
the
parties state that addiction to narcotic drugs constitutes a serious evil for the
individual and is fraught with social and economic danger to mankind; they
declare that they are conscious of their duty to prevent and combat that evil,
whilst recognizing that the medical use of narcotic drugs is indispensable for
the relief of pain and that adequate provision must be made to ensure the
availability of narcotic drugs for such purposes. Pursuant to Article 4 of the
Convention
the
parties
are
to
take
all
the
measures
necessary
to
limit
exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production,
manufacture,
export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs.
10
As a result, drugs which are not confined within channels of distribution
strictly controlled
by the competent
authorities for
use for
medical
and
scientific purposes are subject, by definition, to a total prohibition of impor­
tation and distribution in all the Member States.

JUDGMENT OF 26. 10. 1982 — CASE 221/81
11 In
practice,
as
soon
as such
drugs
are
discovered
they
are
seized
and
destroyed in accordance with the national drugs laws, except in a number of
rare cases where the product seized lends itself to medical or scientific use
and
is
released
into
controlled
channels
of
distribution,
whereupon
it
becomes subject to customs duties.
12
On the other hand, drugs distributed through illegal channels are not subject
to customs duties when they remain within
such channels, regardless of
whether they are discovered and destroyed or are not detected by the auth­
orities.
13 A customs debt cannot therefore arise upon the importation of drugs which
may not be marketed and integrated into the economy of the Community.
The introduction of the Common Customs Tariff, provided for in subpara­
graph (b) of Article 3 of the Treaty, falls within the scope of the objectives
assigned to the Community in Article 2 and the guide-lines laid down in
Article 29 for the operation of the customs union. Imports of drugs into the
Community, which can give rise only to repressive measures, fall wholly
outside those objectives and guide-lines.
1 4 That view is confirmed by the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 803/68 of
the Council of 27 June 1968 on the valuation of goods for customs purposes
(Official Journal, English Special Edition 1968 (I), p. 170) and by those of
Council Directive 79/623/EEC of 25 June
1979 on the harmonization of
provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to
customs debt (Official Journal, 1979, L 179, p. 31). The preamble to that
directive states specifically that the moment when the customs debt arises
must be defined in the light of the economic nature of the duties on imports
and in 'terms of the conditions under which the goods subject to import
duties are integrated into the economy of the Community. In such circum­
stances, no customs debt can arise when drugs are imported through illegal
channels
of
distribution,
since they must
be seized
and
destroyed
upon
discovery instead of being put into circulation.
15
Moreover,
as the national court points out, there
is no justification
for
making
a distinction in that regard between drugs which have not
been
3690

discovered
and
those
which
are
destroyed
under
the
control
of
the
competent authorities, since if such a distinction were made the application
of customs duties would be subject to the chance of discovery.
16
It is apparent from
the foregoing
that no customs debt
arises upon
the
importation
of
drugs
otherwise
than
through
economic
channels
strictly
controlled by the competent authorities for use for medical and
scientific
purposes.
17
This finding is without prejudice to the powers of Member States to take
criminal proceedings in respect of contraventions of their drugs laws and to
impose appropriate penalties, including fines.
18
In the light of this answer, it is unnecessary to deal with the other questions
raised by the national court.
Costs
19
The costs incurred by the Government of the French Republic and by the
Commission of the European Communities, which
have submitted
obser­
vations to the Court, are not recoverable. As these proceedings are, in so far
as the parties to the main proceedings are concerned, in the nature of a step
in the proceedings before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter
for that court.
On those grounds,
THE COURT,
in answer to the question referred to it by the Finanzgericht Düsseldorf by
order of 10 June 1981, hereby rules:

OPINION OF MR ADVOCATE GENERAL CAPOTORTI
DELIVERED ON 30 JUNE 1982 1
Mr President,
Members of the Court,
1.
The
problem
of
the
customs
treatment
to
be
accorded
to
smuggled
drugs,
which
is
the
common
subject-
matter
of
the
two
cases,
221/81
and
240/81, has recently been examined by
the Court, giving rise to the judgment of
5 February 1981 in Case 50/80, Horváth
v
Hauptzollamt
Hamburg-Jonas
[1981]
ECR 385. In that judgment it was stated
that "the introduction
of the
Common
Customs
Tariff
no
longer
leaves
a
Member
State
the
power
to
apply
customs duties to drugs which have been
smuggled in and
destroyed
as soon
as
they were discovered but does leave it
full freedom to take criminal proceedings
in respect of offences committed, with all
the
attendant
consequences,
including
fines".
The questions raised in these two cases
call for
development
and expansion
of
the previous analysis of the Community
customs tariff rules (and in particular the
provisions of Article 9 (1) and Articles 18
to
29
of
the
EEC
Treaty).
The
fundamental
point
to
be
established
is
