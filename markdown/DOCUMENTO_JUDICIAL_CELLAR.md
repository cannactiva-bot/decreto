## EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

## CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

## - 

## Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

### Farming and food are strategic sectors for the Union, providing safe and high-quality food to

### 450 million Europeans at affordable prices and playing a key role for European as well as

### global food security. At the same time, they are essential for sustaining the economy and life

### in rural areas, as well as an important part of the solution in the protection of climate, nature,

### soils, water, and biodiversity currently under stress. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)

### is at the heart of the European project and has committed more than 60 years ago to ensuring

### food security and a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in line with the EU

Treaties’ objectives.

### Such commitment is as relevant today as it was then, as the EU agricultural sector continues

### to face significant challenges. Uneven global playing fields, some import dependencies and

### vulnerability to geopolitical uncertainties add to the long-term uncertainty faced by EU

### farmers. At the same time, farmers must get a better revenue from the market, enabling them

### to make the necessary investments for future-proof and resilient farms. For this to materialise,

### current imbalances in the food chain where an unfair distribution of revenues, risks and the

burden of costs often disproportionately affect primary producers, must be addressed.

### These challenges justify public intervention for the sector and at the same time call for a

### robust and adaptive policy response to ensure a competitive, resilient, and sustainable

### agricultural sector. In line with the Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture

### and Food’1, such policy response would also contribute to ensure a more attractive and

### predictable sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive and attract future generations. In

### this context, defining proper enabling conditions at EU level together with an ambitious set of

### tools would help farmers to leverage their entrepreneurial potential, reinforce their position in

### the value chain, including incentives for farmers to share risks (e.g., via producer

### organisations or cooperatives). At the same time, by supporting investments in training,

### exchange of best practices, uptake of innovative production methods and proper risk

### management practices at farm level, farmers are thereby supported to explore different

### income sources and grasp new market opportunities, such as those linked to the growing

### bioeconomy applications of hemp.

### This is why specific support for certain sectors is considered of strategic nature to contribute

### to achieving the CAP objectives and to reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments.

### Equally important is EU support for protein crops considering the agronomic challenges and

### climatic vulnerability limiting the interest by farmers to engage in this sector. At the same

### time, this particular attention is also determined by the need to reduce the Union dependence

### on imports for high-quality proteins, and reinforce, in line with the Vision, the EU open

### strategic autonomy.

### In this context and as recalled by the Vision, sustainable livestock remains an essential part of

### the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion. The Union livestock sector is

### particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition, and it is required to meet

### high production standards that are not always rewarded by the market. Recognising the

### natural composition of meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and

### consumers becomes important as meat-related terms often carry cultural significance.

### In line with the Niinistö Report on the Preparedness and Readiness of the EU2 and in the

### Preparedness Union Strategy3, preparedness considerations should be integrated into all

### Union policies. This new reality has been marked by significant shocks, from the pandemic,

### the Russian war of aggression and market disturbances to animal and plant diseases and a

### volatile geopolitical situation. This is why, to ensure the delivery of EU Treaty objectives

### when it comes to ensuring the availability of supply, also in time of emergencies and severe

### crises, preparedness in the agricultural sector across Member States should be enhanced. This

### should be achieved by complementing national initiatives, enhancing coordination among

### Member States and between Member States and the Commission and improving efficiency

### and fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, while fully respecting national

### competences and the specific circumstances of each Member State as well as the principles of

### subsidiarity and proportionality. In particular, the Commission Communication ‘Union

### Stockpiling Strategy: Boosting the EU’s material preparedness for crisis’4 stresses that in

### severe, long-term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national

### measures to ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal

### functions.

### At the same time, in line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food, reconnecting EU

### consumers - especially vulnerable groups such as children - with food and local territories

### remains essential for the future of farming in Europe. For this reason, efforts to promote the

### quality of EU food on European markets, including in the outermost regions, as well as on the

### international markets should continue. Such initiatives would enhance both the

### competitiveness of the agricultural sector as well as encourage healthier eating habits among

### the general public. In this respect, the aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables and of milk

### and milk products in educational establishments (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be

### effective in increasing the consumption of selected agricultural products, but its effectiveness

### and coherence with other CAP instruments should be further strengthened.

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council5 sets forth the

### fundamental rules for the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products

### (CMO). For the period 2028 to 2034, financial support for measures laid down in that

### Regulation will be governed by the legal framework set out in Regulation (EU) …/… of the

### European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF]6. This support will also be subject to the

### rules specified in Regulation (EU) .../… of the European Parliament and of the Council

### otherwise specified.

### Similarly, the EU school scheme and support for specific agricultural sectors will receive

### financial backing through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) under

### Regulation (EU) …./… [NRPF Regulation]. However, since these are connected to

### agricultural product markets, the specific rules on the type of interventions should be laid

### In addition, in order to take into account developments in the agricultural sector and to

### improve the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, certain provisions of that

## LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

## - 

## Legal basis

### Articles 42, 43(2) and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)

### are the basis for the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council

### amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### The legal basis provides for: the establishment of the common organisation of agricultural

### markets and other provisions that are necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the

### common agricultural policy, and rules on specific measures in outermost regions.

## - 

## Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

### Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, agriculture is a field of shared

### competence between the Union and the Member States, and the principle of subsidiarity

### therefore applies.

### Given the EU-wide dimension of the common market organisation and the fact that it

### regulates the free movement of goods of agricultural products in the internal market, the

### different issues need to be addressed at EU level than at the level of the Member States acting

### individually. Moreover, the proposed changes are amendments of the existing common

### market organisation for agricultural products.

## - 

## Proportionality

### The proposal comprises limited and targeted changes to the current legislation, which are

### necessary for the good functioning of the existent common market organisation.

## - 

## Choice of the instrument

### Given the objectives and content of the proposal, an amendment to the existing regulations is

### the most appropriate instrument.

EVALUATIONS,

STAKEHOLDER

## CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

### The proposal is part of the review of the CAP for post-2027 for which an overall impact

### assessment and stakeholder consultations have been carried out.

## - 

## Fundamental rights

### The proposed amendments respect the rights and observe the principles enshrined in the

### Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as laid down in Regulations (EU) .../...

### [NRPF Regulation]. The provisions of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] concerning

### the respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law will apply also to the EU school scheme

### and the support for agricultural sectors.

## BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

### The EU school scheme and the support for agricultural sectors will be supported by the Fund

### for which rules are laid down in Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../...

### [Performance Regulation]. As regards the EU school scheme, Commission Implementing

### Decision (EU) 2023/106 fixes the indicative allocations of Union aid to Member States for

### school fruit and vegetables and for school milk for the period from 1 August 2023 to 31 July

### 2029, thus it encroaches on the next multiannual financial framework (‘MFF’) period, for the

### years 2028 to 2034. As with the CAP post-2027 a new school scheme will be set up from

### 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-month period, from 1 August to

### 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its implementation and financing will still

### fall under the current MFF.

## 5.

## OTHER ELEMENTS

## - 

## Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

### This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028-

### 2034 multiannual financial framework which is set out in the proposal for a Regulation (EU)

### .../… [Performance Regulation], which establishes a budget expenditure tracking and

### performance framework along with other horizontal rules for Union programmes and

### activities, unless otherwise specified.

## EU school scheme interventions

### The legal provisions provide the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the scheme

### and its basic requirements, while Member States would bear greater responsibility as to how

### they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better

### take into account local conditions and needs. Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] rules

### should apply to the EU school scheme while specific rules on that type of intervention should

### be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### In order to reduce the intake of free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of

### products high in free sugars and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children

### of the variety of products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities,

### the distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with

### criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards. Member States

### should ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain topics. As the

### case may be and to avoid duplications, the national curriculum can be used instead of the

### scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products potentially high

### in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, those products should be

### excluded from the EU school scheme. Those new elements emerge from the evaluation of the

### scheme, as thoroughly analysed in the impact assessment.

## Sectoral interventions

### The legal provisions define minimum requirements concerning the contents and policy

### objectives for such types of intervention which have the overall aim to ensure the efficient

### functioning and stability of agricultural markets. This would ensure a level playing field in the

### internal market and lay down conditions of equal and fair competition. When including

### interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should ensure consistency

### with other interventions at a sectoral level. The types of intervention in certain sectors should

### provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops, apiculture products, olive oil

### and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other sectors and products listed in Annex I to

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and, for which the establishment of specific interventions is

### deemed to have beneficial effects on the achievement of some or all of the general and

### specific objectives of the CAP pursued by Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation].

# EN

### 6

# EN

## Protein crops

### The legal provisions introduce specific rules for the mandatory recognition of producers and

### interbranch organisations in this sector. This would help to strengthen the value chain at

### regional, national and transnational level, and address agronomic challenges jeopardising

### farmers’ interest in this sector.

### In order to support the production of protein crops and reduce the Union dependence on

### imports for high-quality proteins, a distinct protein crop sector should be created in Annex I to

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. For that purpose, the protein crop sector will replace the

### current dried fodder sector. Products belonging to the protein crop sector will be moved from

### Part XXIV of Annex I to a new Section 1 in Part IV of Annex I, to Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013. Dried fodders which are not protein crops will be moved from the current Part IV

### of Annex I to Part XXIV of that Annex. The reference to the dried fodder sector should be

### removed from Article 6 on marketing years.

### Transitional provisions should be added in Articles 154 and 158 of Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013 for the recognition of existing producer organisations (POs) and interbranch

### organisations (IBOs) already recognised for products that fall under the new protein crop

### sector.

### The protein crop sector should be added to the list of sectors for which Member States are

### obliged to recognise, on request, producer organisations and interbranch organisations

### (Article 159, points (a) and (b), respectively of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013).

## Marketing standards

### In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for dried

### leguminous vegetables and soya bean11, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay

### down marketing standards for protein crops to better inform consumers about the origin of the

### protein crops products they purchase. For the same reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat

### meat should be added to the list for which marketing standards can be adopted. In addition,

### with the objective of possibly harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheeses

### to ensure a common basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to

### provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.

## Hemp

### Hemp falls under the CMO of the CAP, with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 expanding its

### scope beyond fibre use. Farmers can receive area-based CAP payments if they meet standard

### and hemp-specific criteria, including growing varieties with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (‘THC’)

### content below 0,3 % to prevent illicit crop cultivation.

### The European Court of Justice12 ruled that cannabidiol (‘CBD’) from the whole Cannabis

### Sativa plant is not a drug under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However,

### inconsistencies among Member States' regulations limit full plant utilisation and economic

### potential, especially concerning flowering tops. These discrepancies can hinder farmers from

### accessing CAP support or marketing hemp products across Member States.

# EN

### To address this, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will include rules on hemp production and

### marketing. Article 189 will be amended, and Annex I, Part VIII will be expanded to

### encompass all hemp plant parts as agricultural products, provided CAP requirements are met.

### This aims to align with the EU hemp market's growth, offering legal certainty to farmers.

### New legal provisions will also uphold public health protection, keeping strict seed

### certification and a 0,3 % THC limit, ensuring compliance with international drug conventions.

### Scientific evidence supports low health risk from hemp varieties with up to 0,3 % THC. To

### harmonise Annex I, Part VIII, changes will also apply to linseed, moving relevant products

### from Annex I, Part XXIV, Section 1.

### Transitional provisions will protect existing producer organisations and allow farmers to

### market hemp sown before new rules apply. With a deferred application, stakeholders will

### have time to adjust to the new regulatory framework.

## Sugar

### Article 125 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying sugar beet

### and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade, as described in Part

### II, Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to conform to the purchase terms laid

### down in Annex X to that Regulation. Those provisions should be amended for the sake of

### clarity and consistency as regards the parties to the agreements within the trade and as regards

### the products concerned by those agreements and subject to purchase terms.

### Furthermore, in order to enhance legal clarity and reinforce the protection of the rights of beet

### sellers in contractual relationships with sugar undertakings, it is necessary to amend point

### VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 to explicitly provide that the ownership of

### the beet pulp remains with the beet seller unless otherwise agreed.

### To give stakeholders from the sugar sector sufficient time to adapt, the application of the

### changes concerning the agreements within the trade should be deferred until 1 October after

### the year of entry into force of the Regulation.

## Additional import duties

### Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation method

### that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of additional

### import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in Article 5(4) of the

### World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, Article 182(1) of Regulation

### (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that the calculation should be based on the

### average yearly imports in the three preceding years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that additional duties are not to be imposed where

### imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where effects would be disproportionate

### to the intended objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union

### market is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard

### currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement goes

### beyond obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in order to address

### stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, the referred paragraph 2 should be deleted.

## Rules on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis

### Legal provisions introduce obligations for Member States to adopt baseline preparedness

### measures that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and

### response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on stocks of

# EN

### 8

# EN

### agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and participation in EU-level

### stress testing exercises. These efforts should be complemented by enhanced obligations

### during crises or high-risk situations, including mandatory reporting.

### The Union Stockpiling strategy aims to combine centralised reserves with contributions from

### Member States, supported by public-private partnerships to ensure efficiency, scalability and

### cost-effectiveness. Where Member States establish and manage reserves of agricultural

### products, rules should be introduced to ensure that such measures are designed in a manner

### that minimises market distortions.

## Meat designations

### Specific legal provisions should be introduced to protect meat-related terms in order to

### enhance transparency in the internal market as regards food composition and nutritional

### content and ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices, particularly for those

### seeking a specific nutritional content that is traditionally associated with meat products.

## POSEI

### In view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../...

### [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning

### the use of a logo for the marketing of quality agricultural products in the outermost regions

### and the State aid derogation for national payments for the sugar sector in the French

### outermost regions should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

## Reinsert missing rules and empowerments

### Rules as well as empowerments relevant for measures provided for by Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013 were laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and are currently laid down in

### Regulation (EU) 2021/2116. Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in

### view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../...

### [Performance Regulation], rules and empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116

### concerning public intervention and aid for private storage, tariff quotas, recognition of

### producer organisations and securities should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013.

## Deferred application and transitional rules

### In order to allow Member States and operators sufficient time to comply with the new rules,

### the date of application should be postponed for amendments related to agreements within the

### trade for the sugar sector, conditions for the marketing, production and imports of hemp, and

### the provisions on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis.

### Furthermore, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new EU school scheme, the deletion

### of the provisions relating to the EU school scheme laid down Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013

### should apply from 1 January 2028, but should continue to apply in respect of measures

### implemented until 31 December 2027. Moreover, as the current EU school scheme will be

### discontinued on 31 December 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-

### month period, from 1 August to 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its

### implementation and financing will still fall under the current MFF.

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council17

### provides for all basic elements of the common organisation of the markets in

### agricultural products.

### (4)

### The CAP support provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the period post-

### 2027 will be supported by the Fund and subject to the rules laid down in Regulations

### (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the

### Council [Performance Regulation]18, as complemented by Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013.

### (5)

### The production of protein crops in the Union faces persistent difficulties, due in

### particular to volatile supply and demand at local level and the agronomic challenges of

### their cultivation, which make them a higher-risk option for farmers. In order to support

### their production and reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality

### proteins, it is appropriate to create a distinct protein crop sector in Annex I to

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the setting up of

### producer and interbranch organisations in the protein crop sector, and thereby

### strengthen the value chain at regional, national and transitional level, its recognition

### should be made mandatory. As the main products of the dried fodder sector listed in

### Part IV of Annex I to that Regulation should be included in the protein sector, the

### dried fodder sector should be removed from Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (6)

### By its judgment of 7 September 2016 in Case C-113/1419, the Court of Justice of the

### European Union (‘the Court’) annulled Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013

### determining the reference thresholds for agricultural products on the grounds that

### those thresholds should have been adopted by the Council only, on a proposal from the

### Commission, on the basis of Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the

### European Union (TFEU). It is therefore appropriate to delete Article 7 of Regulation

### (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (7)

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for public intervention. Regulation

### (EU) 2021/2116 laid down rules for public intervention expenditure and empowered

### the Commission to supplement that Regulation with rules on the type of measures

### eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions, the eligibility

### conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the

### paying agencies, on flat rates determined by the Commission, or on flat-rate or non-

### flat-rate amounts provided for by the agricultural legislation in specific sectors, the

### valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be

### taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and

### the determination of the amounts to be financed. Since these rules are necessary for the

### functioning of the system of public intervention, the existing empowerments should be

### integrated in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### In addition to the rules on public intervention, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays

### 1306/2013 and in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the

### Council23 to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning checks and penalties

### related to public intervention and aid for private storage should be integrated into

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (9)

### In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to

### supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with rules on reduction of payment of aid

### in case operators do not comply with their obligations relating to the conditions for

### public intervention or for private storage. The Commission should also be empowered

### to adopt, by way of implementing acts, uniform rules for Member States for the tests

### and methods to be applied in order to establish the eligibility of products for public

### intervention and private storage and the use of tendering procedures for public

### interventions or for private storage, on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be

### conducted by Member States with regard to the respect of obligations, commitments

### and eligibility criteria for public intervention or for private storage as well as on the

### No 1308/2013 (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be effective in increasing the

### consumption of selected agricultural products. In order to contribute to achieving the

### CAP objectives, the EU school scheme should be continued. However, in order to

### increase its effectiveness and to ensure coherence with other CAP instruments, the EU

### school scheme should be based on delivery of performance and should be

### implemented as a type of intervention supported by the Fund. The Union should set

### they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible

### to better take into account local conditions and needs. Rules laid down in Regulations

### (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) …/… [Performance Regulation] should apply

### to the EU school scheme, as complemented by this Regulation. The EU school scheme

### being a market intervention measure, the specific rules on the type of intervention

### should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (11)

### The objective of the EU school scheme is to reconnect children with agriculture and

### increase healthy eating habits. As children from vulnerable groups are more prone to

### have unhealthy diets, Member States should be given the possibility to focus on these

### groups according to socio-economic considerations. In order to reduce the intake of

### free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of products high in free sugars

### and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children of the variety of

### products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities, the

### distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with

### criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards. Member

### States should ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain

### topics. To avoid duplicates, the national curriculum can be used instead of the EU

### school scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products

### potentially high in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, it is

### appropriate to exclude those products from the EU school scheme.

### (12)

### Considering that the EU school scheme implemented under the Fund is to cover the

### period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034, the deletion of the provisions

### relating to the EU school scheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation

### (EU) No 1308/2013 should apply from 1 January 2028. In order to ensure a smooth

### transition, it should be provided that the deleted provisions continue to apply in respect

### of measures implemented until 31 December 2027. Furthermore, considering that the

### EU school scheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013 will therefore be discontinued before the end of school year 2027/2028,

### which runs from 1 August 2027 until 31 July 2028, the overall limit of Union aid laid

### down per school year in Article 23a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, should be

### proportionally reduced for that school year.

### (13)

### Types of intervention in certain sectors are needed to contribute to achieving the CAP

### objectives and reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments. Minimum

### requirements concerning the contents and objectives for such types of intervention

### should be established at Union level in order to ensure a level playing field in the

### internal market and avoid conditions of unequal and unfair competition. When

### including interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should

### ensure consistency with other interventions at sector level. The types of intervention in

### certain sectors should provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops,

### apiculture products, olive oil and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other

### sectors and products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. In particular,

### given the Union’s deficit on plant protein and the environmental benefits their

### production brings, legumes should be included among the products eligible for support

### while respecting the EU WTO schedule on oilseeds.

### (14)

### In order to protect the financial interests of the Union’s budget, and ensure that

### penalties are proportionate, effective and dissuasive, the Commission should be

### empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013

### with rules on the suspension, reduction and recovery for payments of aid for sectoral

### interventions in case of non-respect of the recognition criteria by the producer

### organisations. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, by way of

### implementing acts, rules on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by

### Member States on producer organisations or associations of producer organisations to

### verify compliance with the recognition criteria, as well as rules on a unique

### identification system of recognised producer organisations and associations of

### producer organisations.

### (15)

### In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for

### dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean24, it is appropriate to provide for the

### possibility to lay down marketing standards for protein crops to better inform

### consumers about the origin of the protein crops products they purchase. For the same

### reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat meet should be added to the list for which

### marketing standards may be adopted. In addition, with the objective of possibly

### harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheeses to ensure a common

### basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to provide for the

### possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.

### (16)

### The Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food’ recalls

### livestock is an essential part of the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion.

### Sustainable livestock systems are essential for the Union economy, the viability of

### rural areas and the preservation of the environment and rural landscapes. The Union

### livestock sector is particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition

### and it is required to meet high production standards that are not always rewarded by

### the market. In this context, it is necessary to acknowledge the natural composition of

### meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and consumers. Meat-

### related terms often carry cultural and historical significance. It is therefore appropriate

### to protect meat-related terms to enhance transparency in the internal market as regards

### the food composition and nutritional content and ensure that consumers can make

### well-informed choices, particularly for those seeking a specific nutritional content that

### is traditionally associated with meat products.

### (17)

### Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council25

### introduced a logo to encourage farmers in the outermost regions to continue to supply

### high-quality products and to promote their marketing. In view of Regulations (EU)

### .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid

### down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning the use of the logo should be

### integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and apply from 1 January 2028.

### Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying

### sugar beet and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade,

### as described in Part II, Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article

### 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to

### conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex X to that Regulation. For the sake

### of clarity, Article 125, Part II, Section A, points 5 and 6, of Annex II, and Annex X to

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to ensure consistency between

### (19)

### Innovation and the growth of the bioeconomy have led to new applications for hemp

### biomass derived from all parts of the plant. This provides farmers with additional

### opportunities to valorise the plant beyond fibre production, making hemp a more

### attractive and competitive crop. In addition, growing hemp has environmental and

### climate benefits as it does not require pesticides or fertilisers and improves soil

### structure. Several hemp products, including raw hemp (CN 5302), hemp seeds (CN

### 1207 99 91) and other hemp parts (CN 1211 90 86) are listed as agricultural products

### in Annex I to the TFEU. In the interest of clarity, the products covered by the flax and

### hemp sector listed in Annex I, Part VIII, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be

### amended to include hemp products other than raw hemp.

### (20)

### Some Member States have adopted national measures, on grounds of health

### protection, that prohibit the production or marketing of specific hemp products. These

### divergent national approaches undermine the proper functioning of the common

### market organisation, create legal uncertainty and barriers in the internal market and

### cause unfair competition between farmers in different Member States.

### (21)

### In compliance with various international instruments which the Member States have

### cooperated on or acceded to, as the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic

### Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, the marketing

### of narcotic drugs should be prohibited, with the exception of strictly controlled trade

### or use for medical and scientific purposes. However, it follows from the reasoning of

### the Court in Case C-663/1826 that non-psychoactive products as cannabidiol derived

### from hemp varieties with a low Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol content are not to be

### considered narcotic drugs under these conventions.

### (22)

### Scientific evidence also suggests that hemp products obtained from varieties

### containing a maximum tetrahydrocannabinol content of 0.3 % are unlikely to pose a

### risk to human health. Therefore, to ensure legal certainty, promote the development of

### the sector, guarantee a level playing field across the Union and support the proper

### functioning of the common market organisation, while protecting public health

### interests, it is necessary to lay down harmonised rules at Union level for the

### production and marketing of hemp agricultural products that provide public health

### safeguards. In particular, these rules should include a uniform maximum limit of

### tetrahydrocannabinol content, as well as other appropriate safeguards.

### (23)

### Furthermore, it is also appropriate to amend Article 189 of Regulation (EU) No

### 1308/2013 that lays down rules on the imports of hemp in order to ensure consistency

### with the new Union rules on the marketing of hemp products.

### (24)

### In order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid disproportionate disruption for farmers,

### transitional arrangements should be put in place for the placing on the market of hemp

### products derived from hemp plants sown before the date of application of the new

### marketing conditions. Those products should be allowed to continue to be marketed

### subject to the rules in force prior to that date and only until [31 December of the year

### In order to ensure a smooth transition following the creation of the protein crop sector,

### and to provide legal certainty and continuity for recognised producer or interbranch

### organisations, it is appropriate to provide that producer or interbranch organisations

### already recognised before [date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] for

### products that fall under the new protein crop sector should be deemed to be recognised

### in that sector. Such producer organisations should also retain their recognition for

### other products listed under other sectors. However, in cases where they no longer meet

### the relevant conditions for recognition in one or more sectors, Member States should

### withdraw the corresponding recognition no later than [31 December 20XX at least 2

### In order to ensure a smooth transition following the amendment of the products listed

### Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation

### method that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of

### additional import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in

### Article 5(4) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture,

### Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that

### the calculation should be based on the average yearly imports in the three preceding

### years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that

### additional duties are not to be imposed where the imports are unlikely to disturb the

### Union market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended

### objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union market

### is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard

### currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement

### goes beyond the obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in

### order to address the stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, that paragraph

### 2 should be deleted.

### Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 granted a state aid derogation for national payments for

### As underlined in the Joint Communication on the European Preparedness Union

### Strategy28, the Union should strengthen its preparedness in response to growing risks

### and deep uncertainty, with the objective of establishing a secure and resilient Union

### equipped with the capacities to anticipate, respond to and manage threats and hazards,

### regardless of their nature or origin. Preparedness considerations should be integrated

### into all Union policies. The Commission Communication ‘EU stockpiling strategy:

### Boosting the EU's material preparedness for crises’29 stressed that in severe, long-

### term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national measures to

### ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal

### functions.

### (32)

### To ensure the availability of supply, set out as one of the objectives of the CAP in the

### TFEU, also in time of emergencies and severe crises, preparedness in the agricultural

### sector should be enhanced. This should be achieved by complementing national

### initiatives, enhancing coordination among Member States and between Member States

### and the Commission and improving efficiency and fostering a culture of preparedness

### and resilience, while fully respecting the national competences and the specific

### circumstances of each Member State and the principles of subsidiarity and

### proportionality.

### (33)

### Member States should therefore be required to adopt baseline preparedness measures

### that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and

### response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on

### stocks of agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and

### participation in Union-level stress testing exercises. Where Member States establish

### and manage reserves of agricultural products, they should be implemented as part of

### their national and/or regional preparedness and response plans and should be designed

### in a manner that minimises market distortions. Those preparedness efforts should be

### complemented by enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, including

### mandatory reporting.

### (34)

### In order to ensure the uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions

### concerning the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises,

### implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards reporting

### requirements concerning the food security preparedness and response plans, cross-

### border cooperation in the framework of development and application of the food

### security preparedness and response plans, coordinated actions for the establishment

### and management of reserves, such as the identification of categories of products for

### the establishment of the reserves and the development of joint risk assessments and

### early warning mechanisms to mitigate cross-border supply risks and ensure continuity

### of supply during disruptions, voluntary solidarity and mutual assistance mechanisms

### by which Member States make parts of their reserves available to another Member

### State facing severe shortages, real-time reporting on stocks and other relevant

### information as well as technical and procedural requirements for the secure handling

### and exchange of information. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with

### Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council30.

### (35)

### Various provisions of agricultural legislation require that security be lodged to ensure

### the payment of a sum due if an obligation is not met. This is in particular the case for

### the management of tariff quotas and of public intervention and private storage. In view

### of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance

### Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 concerning securities

### should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The empowerments to adopt

### delegated and implementing acts concerning securities should also be maintained and

### therefore integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (36)

### In particular, in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment, equity and the respect of

### proportionality when lodging a security, that delegation of power should cover rules

### on securities specifying the responsible party in the event that an obligation is not met,

### laying down the specific situations in which the competent authority may waive the

### requirement of a security, the conditions applicable to the security to be lodged and the

### guarantor, the conditions for lodging and releasing that security, the specific

### conditions related to the security lodged in connection with advance payments, and

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The relevant implementing acts are to be adopted in

### accordance with the advisory procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.

### For the adoption of these implementing acts the Commission should be assisted by the

### Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural markets established by

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Since that Regulation does not contain any reference

### to the advisory procedure of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, a reference to that

### procedure should be inserted in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.

### (38)

### Section B, point IV, of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down that the

### grading methods to assess the lean-meat content for the purposes of the Union scale

### for the classification of pig carcasses are to be authorised by the Commission.

### Considering that the pig grading methods to assess the lean-meat content are

### authorised per Member State, for the sake of simplicity and reduction of

### administrative burden, the grading methods should be authorised by Member States

### instead of the Commission.

### (39)

### Point VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that delivery

### contracts between beet sellers and sugar undertaking are to set out the arrangements

### for the return or compensation of beet pulp. In order to ensure greater legal clarity and

### reinforce the protection of the rights of beet sellers, it is appropriate to amend Annex

### X to that Regulation to explicitly provide that the beet pulp obtained from the beet

### delivered remains the property of the beet seller unless otherwise agreed. To ensure

### transparency and balanced contractual relations, delivery contracts should explicitly

### stipulate the arrangements for the return, retention or processing of the pulp, including,

### where applicable, the quantities concerned, the sharing of pressing or drying costs, and

### the price or calculation method for any compensation due.

### (40)

### Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.

### (41)

### In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt to the changes, the amendments

### related to agreements within the trade for the sugar sector should apply from [1

### October of the year after the date of entry into force of this Regulation].

### (42)

### In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt, the rules on the conditions for

### the marketing, production and imports of hemp should apply from [1 January after the

### date of entry into force of this Regulation] and the rules on meat-related terms should

### apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation].

### (43)

### In order to give Member States time to start implementing the provisions on the

### availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises, these provisions

### should apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation],

### HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

### of the organisation, association or group, the value of marketed production of that

### product shall be deemed to represent 85 % of the average value in the three previous

### 12-month reference periods. If preventive measures were undertaken, the value of

### marketed production of that product shall be deemed to represent 100 % of the

### average value in the three previous 12-month reference periods.
