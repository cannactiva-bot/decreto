## Purpose (what this document is / is not)

This note is designed as a **politically safe companion** to the existing EIHA paper advocating for a harmonised **0.5% THC** threshold and optional marketing standards.

- It **does not replace** EIHA’s 0.5% CAP line (which is the most winnable “institutional” ask).
- It provides a **second, targeted lane** to articulate **1.0% THC** for **hemp flowers/biomass** as raw agricultural material (CN 1211 90 86), using **risk-based, internal-market language** and **existing EU instruments**.
- It flags how to treat **smokeable / “tobacco substitute” (HS/CN chapter 24)** products as a **separate downstream track** (outside CAP codes), so the 1% discussion does not contaminate the CAP negotiation.

## Core message (copy‑paste in EIHA tone)

1. **0.5% is restoration; 1.0% is modernisation.** The 0.5% line is framed as restoring a historically used and proportionate EU standard; a targeted 1.0% threshold for flowers reflects **market evolution**, **climate/agronomic realities**, and **risk-based regulation** of a distinct product category.
2. **Hemp flowers are a different regulatory object than fibre/seed.** The EU’s hemp framework historically targeted fibre/seed value chains. Today, **CN 1211 90 86 (other parts of the hemp plant)** has become a core raw material for industrial processing/extraction and regulated medical supply chains.
3. **Public‑health risk remains controlled.** The 1.0% proposal is limited to **CBD‑dominant, low‑potency raw materials**, with optional marketing standards as an enforcement‑friendly tool (traceability, testing, labelling, contaminants).

## How to integrate into the existing EIHA paper (section‑by‑section)

### Executive Summary (add 2 sentences)

Add after the 0.5% paragraph:

> In parallel, the hemp sector supports a **targeted, risk-based pathway** towards a **1.0% THC threshold for hemp flowers and other hemp biomass (CN 1211 90 86)**, reflecting market evolution and agronomic realities, while maintaining robust safeguards and enforcement tools. This targeted approach complements—rather than replaces—the 0.5% CAP restoration proposal.

### Section 1 (Background & Policy Context) — add 1 paragraph

Add a paragraph that updates the “1980s hemp = fibre/seed” premise:

> Since the 1980s, hemp has evolved from a largely fibre/seed crop into a diversified bioeconomy raw material, including regulated medical supply chains and industrial processing. The regulatory design should therefore distinguish between traditional fibre/seed chains and modern flower/biomass chains (CN 1211 90 86), ensuring legal certainty and proportionate risk management for each category.

### Section 2 (Why a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold is needed) — keep as is, add a “bridge”

At the end of Section 2, add a bridge paragraph:

> While a harmonised 0.5% threshold is an essential baseline for the internal market and farmer legal certainty, it does not fully address the specific realities of hemp flowers and biomass value chains. A targeted 1.0% threshold for CN 1211 90 86 would further reduce accidental non‑compliance driven by climate variability and support innovation and competitiveness in modern hemp applications.

### Section 3 (Marketing Standards) — expand scope to include CN 1211 90 86

Add a paragraph that explicitly links marketing standards to the “1% for flowers” lane:

> Extending the legal basis for marketing standards to hemp also enables **category‑specific safeguards** (e.g., for CN 1211 90 86), including traceability, batch testing, contaminants limits, and clear labelling—thereby strengthening market integrity without relying on criminal‑law approaches.

### Annexes — add a new Annex III (1% lane)

Create a new Annex III titled:

> Annex III — Targeted pathway to 1.0% THC for hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86)

Include: (i) policy rationale, (ii) public‑health safeguards, (iii) drafting options.

## Evidence anchors we can cite (from this workspace)

### 1) European Pharmacopoeia Cannabis flower monograph (Ph. Eur. 3028) recognises CBD‑dominant flowers with THC up to 1.0%

The following excerpt (CBD‑dominant type) appears in the file `markdown/41. Aportaciones CPP_RD_Cannabis.md`:

> “CBD dominant type: total tetrahydrocannabinol (…) **maximum 1.0 per cent** (dried drug); total cannabidiol (…) **minimum 5.0 per cent** (dried drug).”

Source (workspace): `markdown/41. Aportaciones CPP_RD_Cannabis.md`, lines 2671–2678.

Context note: the same file also states the monograph becomes legally binding in Europe from 1 July 2024, and links to EDQM publication pages (see lines 43110–43159 in the same file).

### 2) Switzerland reportedly moved from 0.3% to 1% THC in 2011 (internal citation to be externally verified)

The file `markdown/114256.md` states (citing an EMCDDA 2020 publication):

> “[…] la venta de productos de cannabis con bajo contenido en THC se inicia en Suiza en 2011 cuando modifica la Ley de fiscalización de estupefacientes, que pasa de definir la planta de cannabis en un nivel del THC del 0'3% al **1%** […]”

Source (workspace): `markdown/114256.md`, lines 313–318.

Note: for EU‑level lobbying, this should be backed with the **official Swiss legal text** (to be appended as an external source in the final version).

### 3) Czech Republic reportedly raised cultivation threshold to 1% THC (internal citation to be externally verified)

The file `markdown/114256.md` also states:

> “República Checa aprobó en Julio de 2022 fijar el límite para el cultivo de cáñamo en una concentración del **1% de THC**.”

Source (workspace): `markdown/114256.md`, lines 348–351.

Note: for EU‑level lobbying, this should be backed with the **official Czech legal text** (to be appended as an external source in the final version).

### 4) Additional “teleological interpretation” anchor (UN manual / leaves 1–2% THC argument)

The file `markdown/REPORTE_PUNTO_INFLEXION_ARTICULO_3_1.md` contains the following advocacy logic:

> “Las hojas no unidas (…) contienen entre un **1 y un 2% de THC** (…) y (…) NO las considera fiscalizadas (…) Por tanto (…) el límite (…) debería ser **superior al 1%**.”

Source (workspace): `markdown/REPORTE_PUNTO_INFLEXION_ARTICULO_3_1.md`, lines 148–151.

## Policy design options (how to “win” politically)

### Option A (recommended for EIHA): two‑lane approach

- **Lane 1 (CAP support / varieties)**: keep EIHA’s ask of **0.5%** (restoration; low political noise).
- **Lane 2 (internal market / product category CN 1211 90 86)**: propose a **targeted 1.0%** threshold for hemp flowers/biomass as raw material, coupled with marketing standards and compliance safeguards.

This reduces the perceived risk of “asking 1% in CAP”, while still building a credible EU‑level pathway for flowers.

#### Drafting sketch (CMO lane): differentiate thresholds by CN code (concept)

If EIHA wants a “minimal‑risk” drafting move, keep the **0.5%** threshold as the general rule, but **differentiate CN 1211 90 86**:

- **CN 5302 (true hemp / fibre)**: keep **0.5%** (aligns with EIHA baseline and traditional value chains).
- **Seeds (ex 1207 99 20 / 1207 99 91)**: keep **0.5%**.
- **CN 1211 90 86 (other parts of the hemp plant, including flowers/biomass)**: set **1.0%**.

This can be drafted as a targeted amendment to the Commission’s proposed hemp marketing provisions (e.g., the part of the text corresponding to “all other parts of the hemp plant … CN 1211 90 86”), and mirrored in the corresponding import provision.

Rationale: it is **not “more THC”**; it is **category‑specific legal certainty** for the only CN category that concentrates cannabinoids and is most exposed to climate‑driven variability.

### Option B: 0.5% now + Commission mandate to assess 1.0% for CN 1211 90 86

If 1% is politically premature, request a **legal review / impact assessment mandate** with a defined timeline, anchored to:

- agronomic/climate evidence,
- internal market fragmentation,
- and the Ph. Eur. 3028 CBD‑dominant benchmark (THC ≤ 1.0%).

## Optional trade framing (use carefully; requires external sourcing)

If EIHA chooses to add a **trade / technical‑barriers** layer (WTO TBT logic, regulatory coherence with key partners), keep it strictly framed as:

- **market integrity + competitiveness + proportionality**, and
- **raw agricultural materials**, not “drug liberalisation”.

Suggested language (draft):

> Where the Union pursues regulatory cooperation and reduces unnecessary technical barriers with strategic partners, the EU hemp framework should remain coherent and proportionate. A targeted 1.0% threshold for low‑risk, CBD‑dominant hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86), combined with enforceable marketing standards, supports legal certainty for operators and avoids unnecessary barriers for compliant raw agricultural materials.

Note: this section should only be kept in a final lobbying version if EIHA can attach **official trade texts / partner‑country legal references** as annexes.

## HS/CN Chapter 24 (“tobacco substitutes”) — keep as a separate downstream annex

Because CAP/CMO hemp provisions focus on agricultural raw materials (e.g., CN 5302, CN 1211 90 86), **products classified under HS/CN Chapter 24** should be addressed separately to avoid “drug policy spillover” into the CAP negotiation.

Note: in EU proposals and common usage, **fibre is CN 5302 (“true hemp”)**; ensure the drafting does not use incorrect codes (e.g., “5290”).

Recommended approach in this addendum:

- Treat smokeable/vaporisable hemp products as a **downstream consumer‑product discussion** (packaging, age‑gating, excise, product safety), distinct from the **agricultural raw material** threshold discussion.
- Include a short “principles paragraph” only:
  - any consumer products should be regulated with **public‑health tools** (quality, labelling, safety) rather than criminal‑law ambiguity;
  - any THC thresholds should be assessed based on **dose and format**, not only % by weight.

## Addressing a predictable objection (Francesco’s point): “0.5% is for varieties, not the final product”

Francesco is **partly right** on the object of regulation: in CAP/CMO drafting, the 0.5% proposal is primarily framed as a **variety/catalogue threshold** (and, in CAP, a **support eligibility** condition).

However, treating “variety threshold” as if it solved “flower market legal certainty” creates a real gap:

- **Enforcement reality**: flower/biomass markets (CN 1211 90 86, and sometimes CN Chapter 24 downstream) face **product‑level controls and national drug‑law risk**, not only seed/cultivation checks.
- **Legal certainty gap**: a variety‑only approach can leave operators exposed to inconsistent national interpretations, even when cultivation is compliant.

**This is the pro‑EIHA conclusion**: keep EIHA’s 0.5% lane as the CAP win, but add a **separate, targeted product‑category lane** for flowers/biomass to reduce fragmentation.

### Suggested “EIHA‑tone” phrasing (use in email or Annex)

> We fully support restoring a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold as the baseline CAP/varieties solution. In parallel, the sector supports a targeted pathway to legal certainty for hemp flowers and biomass (CN 1211 90 86) as a distinct raw‑material category, using marketing standards and a proportionate 1.0% total THC technical benchmark aligned with the European Pharmacopoeia’s CBD‑dominant category (Ph. Eur. 3028).

## Evidence anchors (internal, with exact citations)

### Ph. Eur. 3028 (Cannabis flower) — CBD‑dominant category recognises total THC up to 1.0%

The following is stated in `markdown/41. Aportaciones CPP_RD_Cannabis.md` (**[Pagina 83]**, lines **2671–2678**):

> “Tipo dominante de CBD: […] tetrahidrocannabinol total […] **máximo 1,0 por ciento** (droga deshidratada); […] cannabidiol total […] **mínimo 5,0 por ciento** (droga deshidratada).”

Additional context on EDQM publication / implementation appears in the same file at lines **43110–43159** (EDQM pre‑publication and implementation date).

### CN61 teleological argument (UN manual ST/NAR 40) — “leaves 1–2% THC” point used by stakeholders

`markdown/REPORTE_PUNTO_INFLEXION_ARTICULO_3_1.md` (lines **148–155**) contains the following argument as quoted from a stakeholder submission:

> “Las hojas no unidas […] contienen entre un **1 y un 2% de THC** […] y […] NO las considera fiscalizadas […] Por tanto […] el límite […] debería ser **superior al 1%**.”

### Switzerland / Czech Republic (internal citation; external legal texts recommended for lobbying)

`markdown/114256.md` states that Switzerland moved to a 1% THC line in 2011 (lines **313–318**) and that Czechia adopted a 1% cultivation limit in July 2022 (lines **349–350**).

For EU‑level lobbying, EIHA should attach **primary legal sources** (Swiss law text; Czech amendment text) as annexes.

## Drafting options (CMO lane) — how to make “0.5% baseline + 1% flowers” legally coherent

The EIHA paper’s Annex II currently amends **Article 147b (Production of hemp)** and **Article 147c (Marketing of hemp)** and mirrors the same approach in **imports**. If EIHA wants to advocate “0.5% baseline + 1% for CN 1211 90 86”, it must avoid an internal contradiction between:

- a general “production only if variety ≤ X%” rule, and
- a “marketing of flowers allowed if ≤ Y%” carve‑out.

### Option A (cleanest concept): differentiate thresholds by CN code consistently across production/marketing/imports

- **CN 5302 (true hemp / fibre)**: keep **0.5%**.
- **Seeds (ex 1207 99 20 / 1207 99 91)**: keep **0.5%**.
- **CN 1211 90 86 (other parts of the hemp plant, incl. flowers/biomass)**: set **1.0%**.

This requires mirroring the same differentiation in the relevant “Production”, “Marketing”, and “Imports” provisions.

### Option B (politically “lowest friction”): keep 0.5% as the general rule + add a narrow derogation for CN 1211 90 86

Drafting sketch (conceptual):

- General rule remains: hemp products are produced/marketed if grown from EU‑catalogue varieties meeting the baseline threshold (0.5%).
- **Derogation**: hemp flowers/biomass under CN 1211 90 86 may be marketed if they meet a **CBD‑dominant, low‑risk profile** aligned with Ph. Eur. 3028 (e.g., **total THC ≤ 1.0%** and **total CBD ≥ 5.0%**, dried material), coupled with marketing standards (traceability, batch testing, labelling).

This frames the 1% lane as **risk‑based modernisation** rather than “more THC”.

## Hygiene / messaging risks (important)

- Avoid fragile “number of cigarettes” calculations: they are highly sensitive to the assumed THC % and can backfire when moving from 0.2 → 0.5 → 1.0.
- Fix obvious factual errors before circulation (e.g., “Switzerland is an EEA member” is incorrect).

## Draft language (insertable paragraphs)

### Insertable paragraph — “0.5% restoration + 1% targeted modernisation”

> The sector supports restoring a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold at EU level as a proportionate baseline that strengthens the internal market and legal certainty. At the same time, market evolution and climate variability justify a targeted, risk‑based pathway towards a 1.0% threshold for hemp flowers and other hemp biomass (CN 1211 90 86), combined with marketing standards to ensure product quality, traceability, and effective enforcement.

### Insertable paragraph — “Ph. Eur. 3028 as a European technical benchmark”

> The European Pharmacopoeia’s Cannabis flower monograph (Ph. Eur. 3028) recognises a CBD‑dominant cannabis flower category with total THC up to 1.0% and total CBD at least 5.0% (dried drug). This provides a credible European technical benchmark for defining low‑risk CBD‑dominant flower raw materials and supports a proportionate internal‑market framework for CN 1211 90 86.
