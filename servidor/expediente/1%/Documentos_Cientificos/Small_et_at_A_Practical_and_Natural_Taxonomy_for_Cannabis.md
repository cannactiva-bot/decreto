TAXON 25(4): 405-435. AUGUST 1976
A PRACTICAL AND NATURAL TAXONOMY FOR CANNABIS*
Ernest Small'" and Arthur Cronquist':':
Summary
Variation in Cannabis is evaluated in the context of the confusing systematic history
of this genus. Aside from some experimentally produced polyploids, all Cannabis is
diploid (n = io), and there appear to be no barriers to successful hybridization within
the genus. The present pattern of variation is due in large part to the influence of
man. Two widespread classes of plant are discernible: a group of generally northern
plants of relatively limited intoxicant potential, influenced particularly by selection
for fibre and oil agronomic qualities, and a group of generally southern plants of
considerable intoxicant potential, influenced particularly by selection for inebriant
qualities. These two groups are treated respectively as subsp. sativa and indica, of C.
sativa, the only species of the genus Cannabis. Within each subspecies two parallel
phases are recognizable. The "wild" (weedy, naturalized or indigenous) phase is more
or less distinguishable from the domesticated (cultivated or spontaneous) phase by means
of an adaptive syndrome of fruit characteristics. The resulting four discernible groups
are recognized as varieties.
Introduction
This paper is based largely on garden, laboratory, and herbarium studies of
Cannabis carried out during the past several years by Small at Ottawa, together
with a comprehensive review of the extensive literature bearing on the taxonomy
of the genus. Small has previously presented segments of his studies dealing with
cytology and breeding behavior (Small, I972a), chemical variation (Small and
Beckstead, i973a, I973b; Small et al., I975), morphology of the achenes (Small,
i975a) and numerical taxonomic analysis (Small, I974a, Small et al., I976).
Cronquist's studies, though less intensive than Small's, have led him to the
same conclusions, and the two authors have been in frequent consultation since
1972. Cronquist has also been able to examine the type specimens of Can-
nabis sativa L. and Cannabis indica Lam., and to lectotypify the names Cannabis
sativa var. spontanea Vavilov and Cannabis indica var. kafiristanica Vavilov.
It might have been possible to reach the taxonomic conclusions here presented
from the literature alone, if due attention had been paid to papers in the Russian
language as well as to those in English, German, and French, but such a literature-
based interpretation would have lacked the quality of necessity that we believe is
provided by the recent work done at Ottawa.
In our opinion the studies reviewed in this paper lead inevitably to the
conclusion that Cannabis consists of a single highly variable species. This is true
regardless of whether one emphasizes traditional morphologic and geographic
features, or chemical features, or features of cytology and breeding behavior as
essential specific criteria, and whether one analyzes the phenotypic data by
inspection or with the aid of a computer. Our taxonomy at the infraspecific level
is perhaps debatable, but we believe that it too is strongly supported by the
evidence.

Cannabis is one of the oldest cultivated plants. It has been domesticated for fibre
in the bast of the stems, oil in the fruits, and an intoxicating resin produced in
epidermal glands (Dewey, 1914; Miller, 1970; Small et al., I975). The historical
association of man and marihuana is treated by numerous authors (e.g. Chopra,
1969; Merlin, 1972; Schultes, I973). It has been speculated that Cannabis once
occupied a relatively limited primeval, indigenous range somewhere in central
Asia, and that consequent to its domestication its naturalized and spontaneous
range increased enormously (de Candolle, I885; Ascherson and Graebner, 1911;
Kirchner et al., 1938; Schultes, I970; Small, I972b; du Toit, 1974; Haney and
Kutscheid, I975). It is clear that Cannabis was absent from the New World until
about I545 (Small et al., I975).
Variation in the genus Cannabis is due in large part, as will be indicated, to
selection by man. Formal taxonomic delimitation under this circumstance is
somewhat difficult because of the lack of agreement on the taxonomic disposition
of groups which have been substantially influenced by domestication. Further
complicating consideration of the taxonomy of Cannabis is an extraordinary
forensic debate over the number of species meriting recognition. We shall argue,
however, that the historical treatment of Cannabis, an understanding of the
evolution of variation in this genus, the traditions and present concepts of plant
taxonomy, and the needs of society all suggest a simple, practical, and natural
taxonomy in which only one complex species is accepted.
The classification of variants in the genus Cannabis has recently become the
subject of heated debate in North American courts. The claim has been made
that the name C. sativa, which is used to denote cannabis drugs (marihuana,
hashish, hashish oil) in most North American legislation, is insufficiently
comprehensive to proscribe all kinds of marihuana, because there are other species
of Cannabis, notably C. ruderalis Jan. and C. indica Lam., and that these latter
species are therefore "legal". In the current cause celebre, some taxonomists who
once published expressions of firm position that Cannabis comprises only one
species, have sharply reversed themselves in testifying on behalf of defendants
charged in recent narcotics cases (cf. Schultes et al., I974 and Schultes, 1969,
1970; cf. Emboden, I974a, I974b, and Emboden, I972). The forensic debate is
discussed elsewhere (Small, I974b, I975b, I975c, I975d, I976).
The genus Cannabis is sharply delimited. Although Cannabis and its only near
relative Humulus were once combined (Scopoli, 1772), there is an absolute and
readily perceptible gap between these two genera. The differences are set forth
in many places in the general taxonomic literature, and need not be repeated here.
Variation within the genus Cannabis is continuous for all characters and sets of
characters that have been investigated in any detail. The variation, although
continuous, is not unimodal. It is bimodal with regard to one set of characters
that relate to domestication as opposed to growth in the wild. It is also bimodal
with regard to another set of characters that relate to the purpose for which the
plant has been cultivated: fibre (and to some extent oil) on the one hand, and
psychoactive drugs on the other. These two independent bimodalities intersect so
that four syndromes of more or less closely associated characteristics can be
recognized within the genus (Fig. 6).
Critical factors influencing populational structure in Cannabis are that the
genus is entirely diploid, with n = io (although some polyploids have been artifi-
cially produced; Small, I972a), that the plants are wind-pollinated, that there
appear to be no internal barriers to successful hybridization (Vavilov, 1926 =
Vavilov, I965; Small, 1972a) and that cultivated plants readily escape to the wild
(Janischevsky, 1924; Vavilov, 1926; Vavilov and Bukinich, I929; Scholz, I957).
Two results of the operation of these factors are that wherever Cannabis has
been cultivated for any length of time it also grows "wild", i.e. without cult-
ivation, and that it is impossible to recognize and delineate any wild population
that has not been influenced by hybridization with domesticated populations. If
unaltered wild populations exist (which we doubt) they cannot be clearly
distinguished from those contaminated by the influence of domestication.

Until fairly recently it was widely thought that the intoxicant properties of the
resin of Cannabis were extremely subject to environmental modification. It was
believed that hot, dry climates are necessary to elicit the psychoactive properties of
the resin, and that cool, damp climates have very limited potential for eliciting drug
properties (e.g. Bouquet, I95o, p. I9). It now appears, however, that the intoxicant
characteristics of Cannabis resin are reasonably conservative (Nordal and Braen-
den, I973; Small et al., I975; cf. Haney and Kutscheid, I973; Boucher et al., I974;
Coffman and Gentner, I975). Primarily genetic, as opposed to primarily environ-
mental control of cannabinoid characteristics, is an essential factor in our taxon-
omic treatment of Cannabis. It also appears that the qualitative characteristics of
the resin are reasonably consistent in different parts of the plant (e.g. Rasmussen
and Svendsen, 1973). However, recent work by Turner and his colleagues at
the University of Mississippi suggests that single chemical analyses of certain
strains of Cannabis should be interpreted cautiously. In some strains, marked
diurnal and seasonal qualitative and quantitative variation of the cannabinoids
have been observed (Turner et al., i973b, Turner et al., I975a; cf. Phillips et al.,
1970; Latta and Eaton, I975). Thousands of plants have been examined chemically
at Ottawa, however (Small and Beckstead, i973a), and the taxonomic value of
THC content has been clearly demonstrated.
In plants grown at Ottawa it was found that quantitative variation is primarily
determined by genetic stock, length of vegetative growth and state of maturity.
Resin content (on a relative weight basis) increased to a maximum shortly after
flowering, with some difference in peaking of males and females. In northern
latitudes the shorter season for vegetative growth provides some limitation on
the concentration of resin which can accumulate. Honma et al. (I971) made
similar observations on Cannabis grown in Japan, and noted that resin content
decreases on withering. Once the plants are harvested, oxidative changes occur
slowly, changing the composition of the resin (Turner et al., I973a; cf. Coffman
and Gentner, I974). In particular, THC concentration decreases, and the con-
centration of the non-intoxicant cannabinoid, cannabinol, increases.
Quantitative evaluation of cannabinoid content found in the literature must be
treated with circumspection, because (I) different laboratories have used dif-
ferent techniques, sometimes resulting in quite discordant findings on an absolute
(but not a relative) basis (Le Dain et al., I972); (2) maturity and storage
conditions affect quantities present; and (3) different parts of the plant contain
different concentrations of the cannabinoids, and different investigators sample
differently. Much literature reporting cannabinoid contents refers to "dried flower-
ing tops". Great differences in concentrations (i.e. reports of quantities present
on a relative basis) result, depending on how such material is prepared: if the
achenes and larger twigs are removed, THC concentrations are of course much
higher.
It will be noted that we arbitrarily adopt a concentration of 0.3% Δ9-THC
(dry weight basis) in young, vigorous leaves of relatively mature plants as a
guide to discriminating two classes of plants. This is based on standard-grown
material in Ottawa in gardens, greenhouses and growth chambers, and of course
on our analytical techniques. Dr. C. E. Turner, who has conducted extensive
chemical analysis of Cannabis at the University of Mississippi, has agreed (pers.
com.) that this is a reasonable figure to discriminate two classes of plants. We
found that generally approximately 2% of the dry weight of young leaves of
mature plants, or of the average dry weight of the softer parts of the female
flowering plant (leaves, small twigs, flowers) is comprised of cannabinoids. Since
CBD (cannabidiol, the most common non-intoxicant cannabinoid) and THC
collectively usually compose the bulk of the cannabinoids present, one can
crudely adjust literature reports of cannabinoid concentration for comparison with
our values on the basis that the concentration of CBD and THC should sum to
roughly 2%.
It has been shown that two widespread classes of plants can be discerned with
respect to intoxicant properties (Small and Beckstead, I973a, i973b). Plants orig-

inating from fairly southern countries (approximately south of latitude 30? N.),
where there has been a long history of the use of Cannabis for drug purposes,
are characterized by (a) resin containing a relatively high proportion of intoxic-
ating cannabinoids, often more than half of the total, usually mostly THC, (b)
considerable resin in male plants as well as in females (on a relative weight basis;
females are usually larger than males) and (c) relative slowness of induction of
flowering by short day length. In contrast, plants originating from more northern
locations, where Cannabis has been used primarily as a source of fibre and oil,
are characterized by (a) resin composed primarily of non-intoxicating can-
nabinoids, usually mostly CBD, (b) notably higher resin concentration in female
plants than in male plants, and c) relative rapidity of induction of flowering by
short day length. It should be understood, however, that chemically intermediate
plants are widespread (Small and Beckstead, i973a; Krishnamurty and Kaushal,
I974).
Although the general geographical distribution of psychoactive constituents in
Cannabis is now fairly well understood, additional geographical evaluation of
cannabinoid distribution is still very desirable. The cannabinoids are substantially
carboxylated in fresh material, and are neutralized after harvest on ageing (Grlic
and Andrec, I96I; Kimura and Okamota, I970). (It is to be understood in this
paper wherever cannabinoid concentrations are given that the sum of neutral
and carboxylated fractions is denoted). It has been reported that a relatively
greater proportion of the cannabinoids is decarboxylated in the living plants in
southern strains (Mechoulam, I970). Strains from north-eastern Asia frequently
have trace amounts of the otherwise rare cannabinoid, cannabigerol monomethyl
ether (Small and Beckstead, i973a, i973b). High-THC strains from southern
regions frequently show complete absence of CBD (references in Small and Beck-
stead, I973a, i973b; Small et al., I975), and often have appreciable quantities
of the minor cannabinoid, cannabichromene (Turner et al., I975b). There are
good indications that a number of minor cannabinoids may exhibit a geographical
pattern (Turner et al., I973c; Stromberg, I97I, I972a, I972b, I974b). A geo-
graphical pattern is also somewhat probable for the abundant terpenes present
(Martin et al., I96I; Nigam et al., I965; Hood et al., 1973; Str6mberg, I974a)
and for the flavonoids (Gellert et al., I974).
Lamarck (I785; see Breistroffer (1948) for evidence that the commonly cited
date of 1783 is inapplicable) produced the first nomenclaturally significant
recognition of the two basic kinds of plants of Cannabis, and he did not with a
clear indication that the distinction was based on agronomic properties. "Chanvre
cultive" (C. sativa) was described as having some narcotic properties, but as being
cultivated primarily for other qualities. This taxon was described as cultivated ex-
tensively in Europe for the fibre in the stems, and for the fruit. It had become na-
turalized in Europe. Lamarck pointed out that Linnaeus indicated C. sativa "grew
naturally" in "Persia". Steam (I974) has, however, determined that Linnaeus was
familiar with the fibre cultigens of Europe, and accordingly Steam designated a fi-
bre cultivar as the lectotype of the name C. sativa L. in contrast with "Chanvre
cultive", "Chanvre des Indes" (C. indica) was described by Lamarck as having
too thin a bark to furnish sufficient fibre for agricultural exploitation; rather this
taxon had marked inebriant properties, grew, and was extensively used as an
intoxicant in the East Indies. (The descriptive binomial Cannabis indica predated
Lamarck's use of this name (e.g. Rumpf, I750). Lamarck thought C. indica could
be distinguished from C. sativa by possession of alternate as opposed to opposite
leaves, and narrower leaflets. Cannabis indica was described as being smaller,
more branched, and possessing a firmer, nearly cylindrical stem, and linear-
lanceolate, acuminate leaflets.
Clearly Lamarck had in mind fibre and oil cultivars in his conception of C.
sativa, and inebriant cultivars in his conception of C. indica. The tallness, lack of
branching, hollowness of stem, and nature of bast are all agricultural features of
fibre cultivars, maximizing quality, length, and obtainability; the absence of these
features in inebriant cultivars simply reflects the different selective history of such

plants. Lamarck's supposition that the two taxa can be distinguished on the basis
of leaf insertion is widely acknowledged to be incorrect.
The intoxicant distinctiveness of C. indica led to the frequent use of this
binomial by writers wishing to stress inebriant properties of C. sativa. Indeed, the
binomial was transformed by pharmacologists from a name to a term indicating,
officinally (sic), drug preparations from C. sativa (e.g. Ascherson and Graebner,
1911; Moll et al., I923). Not surprisingly, this led to a great deal of confusion.
Although there has long been considerable appreciation of the distinctiveness of
low-intoxicant plants contrasted with high-intoxicant plants, there has been
relatively little agreement on whether and how the two groups could be distinguish-
ed morphologically, and how they should be treated taxonomically. Early students
of the southern, intoxicant plants (e.g. Dietrich, 1842; Christison, I85o; Dukerly,
1866; Watt, 1889) saw no merit in granting this group separate formal recognition.
Persoon (1807) reduced C. indica to a variety of C. sativa, but did not validate
the combination; Wehmer (191 i) seems to have been the first to do so.
Alphonse de Candolle (1869) reduced C. indica to synonymy with C. sativa, but
he recognized four groupings (a, Kif; f1, vulgaris; y, Pedemontana; 8, Chinensis)
which he described as units of lesser status than varieties, possessing more or less
constant heredity, but subject to considerable environmental modification. Of de
Candolle's forms, Pedemontana and Chinensis are clearly referable to northern
fibre cultivars, vulgaris is a mixture of the northern low-intoxicant and southern
high-intoxicant classes of plant, and Kif is clearly referable to the southern in-
toxicant kind of plant (cf. Dukerly's (1866) and Mikuriya's (i967) discussions of
"Kif").
In a brief treatment, Vavilov (Vavilov and Bukinich, I929, pp. 380-382) placed
some heavily-branched, large-leaved plants he encountered in cultivation in
Afghanistan for drug purposes, in C. sativa L. In doing so, he was consistent with
Lamarck in that the latter did use wide leaflets (as are usually present in the large-
leaved drug cultivars of Afghanistan) as diagnostic of C. sativa as opposed to C.
indica. However, he was inconsistent with Lamarck in that the latter indicated
C. indica had much higher inebriant potential than C. sativa. Vavilov indicated
that C. indica could be distinguished by small leaves, small fruit, and low growth
(not more than one metre in height). Subsequently Serebriakova and Sizov (I940)
maintained Vavilov's distinction between C. sativa and C. indica. "Indian hemp"
(C. indica) was said to be used for the extraction of narcotic substances, and to be
distributed in India, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Israel and North Africa.
In contrast with "common hemp" (C. sativa), Indian hemp was described as
being usually more branched, and having narrower, smaller leaflets, and shinier
seeds. Like Vavilov, Serebriakova and Sizov included some high intoxicant plants
within C. sativa, contrary to the traditional separation of sativa and indica (at
whatever taxonomic level) on the basis of the fibre and oil properties of the former
and intoxicant properties of the latter.
Zhukovsky (1962, 1964) and Schultes et al., (I974) recognize three species of
Cannabis, C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. However, the nature of homo-
logous variation of fruits is not clearly described by these authors (vide infra),
and accordingly their attempt to characterize the species on features of the fruit is
confused. Our extensive contact with Dr. Schultes leads us to suppose that his
conception of C. indica at present is very narrow, and is heavily influenced by his
acquaintance with a large-leaved variant that he collected in Afghanistan (il-
lustrated on p. 359, Schultes et al., I974). Although we would assign this variant
to a broader conception of the intoxicant taxon, Vavilov in 1929 (the date of
the last publication in which he dealt with the taxonomy of Cannabis) would
probably have assigned it to C. sativa because of its large leaves, and Lamarck
might have been tempted to do so in view of its very wide leaflets.
For more than a century, prior to the eruption of the forensic-taxonomic debate
in 1972, very few taxonomists (aside from some in the Soviet Union) accorded
much respect to the formal taxonomic distinction of any of the variants within
Cannabis, even the obvious grouping into northern, low-intoxicant fibre and oil

variants and southern, high-intoxicant "narcotic" variants. This fact is epitomized
by recent publications of some of those most active for the position of the defense
in the current forensic debate, prior to their association with the legal issue, and
their transformation of opinion. Schultes wrote in I970: "Botanists now generally
agree that Cannabis is a monotypic genus, a genus with one species, C. sativa, that
there cannot be recognized any true botanical varieties within this species, and
that this one species has diversified into a great number of ecotypes and cultivated
races. Modern taxonomists, thus, are in agreement with Linnaeus' treatment of
the genus." Emboden wrote in 1972: "Despite much writing to the contrary there
is but a single species of Cannabis - popularly called marihuana - and that is
Cannabis sativa L., the cultivated hemp, so named by Linnaeus in I753."
Recent studies have indicated that when plants are grown under standardized
circumstances, plants of the northern low-intoxicant type can be discriminated
from plants of the southern high-intoxicant type by means of multivariate analysis
of many morphological attributes (Small, I974a; Small et al., 1976). However,
considerable mathematical computation is required in using this way of dist-
inguishing the groups, which could not be identified by practical visual means. In
any case, because of the far greater variability of plants grown under less rigorous
control, this method could not be used to distinguish the two classes of plants in
the wild. Moreover, there is a strong possibility that the discrimination observed
in the garden-cultivated material in the numerically oriented studies was in
considerable part due to the late-maturing property of the high-intoxicant races
examined, and the consequent simultaneous influence of many attributes.
Horticultural Variants
There are many names for horticultural variants of Cannabis, but very few
of these have been validly published as formal taxa under the International Code
of Botanical Nomenclature. Serebriakova and Sizov (1940) presented a quasi-
formal treatment recognizing numerous variants at several infra-specific levels.
This scheme was adopted by several hemp monographers (e.g. Ceapoiu, I958; Ken-
der, 1962), and appears to provide a useful, if artificial guide to cultivars. The
primary classification into "C. sativa" and "C. indica", followed by the splitting
of C. sativa into two subspecies based on whether wild or cultivated, is in
conceptual agreement with our own treatment, although we differ with them
as to the rank and precise circumscription of these groups.
Several names have been used to some extent in the horticultural literature.
These include C. himalayana (Zinger, 1898, p. 207), C. gigantea (Delile, 1849;
Crevost, I917), C. sativa f. gigantea (Voss, i896), C. chinensis (Vilmorin, I85I),
C. sativa var. atripurpurea (Lonachevsky and Kotov, I952), and C. pedemontana
(Camp, 1936; cf. de Candolle, 1869). Geographical epithets are often used very
casually, for example C. americana (Houghton and Hamilton, 1908; Wehmer,
1911), and C. germanica (My, I950), for neither of which was there any attempt
at formal publication or description as species. Dewey (I914) and Schreiber
(I957) provided analyses of hemp cultivars available some decades ago; merci-
fully neither attempted a latinized nomenclature.
The Distinction between "Wild" and "Domesticated", and Taxonomic Delimitation
It is well recognized that cultivated plants frequently coexist in complex
relationships with their wild progenitors (Anderson, I952; Baker, 1972, I974).
One may distinguish, theoretically, "domesticated" plants (those altered by
artificial selection for desired properties), from aboriginally "wild" plants (those
unaffected by such selection). As well, it is sometimes desirable to distinguish
"weedy" plants, keeping in mind that these may be essentially identical to the
domesticated or wild (sensu stricto) phase, or may represent a product of genetic
mingling of these phases. (Harlan and de Wet in I965 expressed the belief that
most weedy biotypes coexistent with cultivars are derived from the latter, rather

than from more aboriginal unaltered stocks). One may recognize several situations,
theoretically (cf. van Steenis, I957, pp. CXCVIII - CCIII; Nicholson et al.,
I969, pp. I92-I93): (I) a simple condition, in which domestication has led to the
creation of a cultivated phase so modified as to be incapable of survival outside of
cultivation. Such plants may coexist with essentially unmodified progenitors
persisting in aboriginal sites. Substantial divergence between the wild and
cultivated phases, and the lack of hybridization between them, facilitate morph-
ological separation and taxonomic recognition at some desired rank. Extinction of
the wild phase simplifies the situation further. (2) Situations of intermediate com-
plexity, in which there is hybridization and introgression between the wild and
cultivated phases, possibly coupled with naturalization and the evolution of
weedy biotypes. Persistence of basically unmodified aboriginal kinds of plants in
a perceptibly indigenous range still allows taxonomic distinction, but perhaps
debatably. (3) A massively panmictic situation, with widespread hybridization and
introgression between the wild and cultivated phases, substantially modifying
aboriginal populations, or resulting in sufficient confusion to preclude reliable
recognition of "primitive", unmodified stocks, and their aboriginal indigenous
range.
Cannabis clearly belongs to the third situation. Cannabis is one of the most
ancient of cultivated crops, and has been domesticated for perhaps as long as
85oo years (Schultes, I969; Schultes and Hofmann, I973). Although it has been
speculated that Cannabis is indigenous in central Asia, there is no agreement on
even an approximate location (Schultes, I970). There are good reasons why one
would not expect to find unaltered extant Anlagen of domesticated Cannabis.
Cannabis has been observed to form spontaneous populations wherever it is grown,
and weedy biotypes are extensively established throughout the world. The wind
pollination of plants such as Cannabis facilitates long-distance genetic interchange.
Wind-pollinated plants with pollen grains the size of Cannabis (about 25 i in dia-
meter) can effectively disperse pollen for hundreds of miles (e.g. Erdtman, I937;
Sack, I949). Significantly, Cannabis produces pollen copiously. Further, all studies
of interfertility reported in Cannabis to the present indicate absence of sterility
barriers between wild and domesticated populations (Vavilov, 1926; Small,
i972a; Davidyan, 1972). Given the possibilities of long distance hybridization,
dispersal and establishment, and the long-continued modification and distribution
of Cannabis by man, we believe it is unlikely that one could find unaltered
aboriginal populations. Even if relatively unaltered aboriginal genotypes are
still extant, there are presently no non-circular means of identifying these, since we
simply cannot establish whether a given variant occupying a discrete geographical
range represents aboriginal material, or is the partial consequence of domestic-
ation (note particularly the numerous variants with discrete distribution ranges
described by Nikiforov, I963). Certainly at present there is no reason to sup-
pose that any of the specific names available in Cannabis have been based on
material unaffected by domestication. Indeed the distinction between wild and
domesticated material has only recently been carefully addressed. The wide-
spread confusion in the early literature regarding whether Cannabis was "indig-
enous" or "spontaneous" in various parts of its range is detailed by Janischevsky
(I924) and Vavilov (1926).
Just as selection either for fibre and oil attributes, or for drug properties, has
resulted in the evolution of kinds of plants, so the different selective regimes under
cultivation and in the wild may be expected to result in kinds of plant. In
particular, it is well known that attributes of propagules, particularly those
influencing distribution, are especially subject to change depending on exposure
to, or release from domestication. Indeed, many parallels exist between the situation
in Cannabis (vide infra) and other domesticated species with similar wild relatives
(examples in Harlan et al., I973).
The differences in propagules between "wild" and domesticated plants of central
Russia were carefully examined by Janischevsky, who subsequently referred
domesticated plants to C. sativa, and wild plants to C. ruderalis or C. sativa var.

ruderalis (Janischevsky, I924). Janischevsky's work represents a considerable
increase in understanding of variation in Cannabis. He noted that in contrast with
fruits of "wild" plants, the achenes of domesticated strains of Cannabis are larger,
relatively blunt at the point of attachment, and relatively barren of an adhering
papery layer homologous with the perianth. In contrast, fruits of wild plants are
smaller, covered by tightly adhering mottled perianth, and have a prolonged
base. As might be expected, mature fruits from wild plants disarticulate readily
and germinate irregularly, whereas fruits from domesticated plants are somewhat
persistent on the plants at maturity and germinate promptly when planted.
Janischevsky carefully examined the nature of the adherent perianth. He
explained its presence in wild plants as reflective of the value of camouflage in
that the perianth is marbled with dark and light areas. He noted that the interior
of the somewhat elongated base of the fruit of wild plants (which he interpreted as
being part of the receptacle), is characterized by oily cells, and he found some
evidence for a mutualistic relationship with the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus L., which
fed on this basal tissue and distributed the achenes. Lonachevsky and Kotov
(I952) state that a similar relationship exists with beetles of the genus Harpalus.
The occurrence of relatively large fruits in domesticated stocks parallels the
situation in many other plants with coexistent wild and cultivated phases (refer-
ences in Baker, I972).
The morphology of the fruit of Cannabis, and the layers which cover it, are
easily misunderstood and generally have been inadequately described in the
literature. A green floral bract envelops the young pistil, except for the exserted
stigmas, and grows with the developing fruit, loosely enclosing it at maturity.
The abaxial surface of this bract is densely covered with secretory and cystolith
hairs. The perianth arises from the base of the young ovary, and grows around
the ovary, adhering closely to it. The perianth is merely a thin, hyaline membrane,
which is mottled with dark areas that are more or less associated with the veins.
In cultivars, the perianth is often not present at maturity, or is evidenced only by
fragments of papery material adhering to the achene. Usually traces of this papery
material are present at the base of the achene, reflecting the fact that growth of the
perianth in cultivars is frequently restricted to the base. (Cultivars have been
described, however, in which the achene is covered by an adherent perianth, as in
wild plants (references in Scholz, I957)). When the perianth is missing, reticulate
venation is easily seen. This is due to veins embedded in the mesocarp of the
fruit. Many authors are familiar with only the domesticated kind of achene, and
have confused this venation with the "marbling" due to the dark and light areas
of the papery perianth. The "marbling" is easily seen in the wild kind of achene,
since the perianth tends to adhere very well over the surface of the exocarp,
obscuring the venation in the mesocarp. The frequent use of the term "mosaic" by
some authors obviously reflects confusion concerning whether the "marbling" of
the papery perianth, or the network of venation of the mesocarp is being denoted.
Note that the venation is obvious in the domesticated achenes shown in Figs. 2 and
4, whereas the marbled perianth is obvious in the wild achenes shown in Figs. 3
and 5. Further details of the structure and variability of the fruits are found in
Small, I975a.
Zhukovsky (I964) refers to the fruits as "spurious nutlets", giving as his reason
the fact that the perianth is often fused to the exocarp. Zhukovsky was under the
mistaken impression that the perianth layer per se conferred hardness on the fruits
of wild plants. Vavilov (I926) asserted that the hardness characteristic of fruits of
wild plants was due to pericarp thickening in the basal part of the fruit. Jani-
schevsky (I924) attributed the hardness of wild fruits to thickening of the ribs of
the achenes. Our studies indicate that hardening may be attributable to one or
both kinds of modification in different wild races. Also, small wild fruits have
walls as thick as larger domesticated fruits, and therefore in proportion to the
size of the fruit, are better protected.
Disarticulation of the fruits from the plants is in small part due to a change in
attitude of the large enveloping bract, which loosens its hold on the achenes. This

bract firmly holds immature fruits, and is often found persistently hooding the
mature fruit of cultivars. However, it is the disarticulation features at the base of
the fruit which are of particular importance to wild plants of Cannabis. The
elongation or constriction of the base of the fruits of wild plants to produce a
short, stout stipe is likely an adaptation facilitating shattering. Disarticulation is
often said to be by means of a "joint" or at a "dehiscence zone" in fruits of wild
populations, with a "circular torus" (Sojak, 1960), or "horseshoe" (Vavilov, 1922;
Janischevsky, I924), or "callus-like ring" (Schreiber, I957) left evident at the
base. Such descriptions are of limited value in distinguishing the wild and domestic-
ated phases. All Cannabis fruits are "jointed" at their base, where disarticulation
occurs by abscission of the fruit from the receptacle. When the abscission occurs
in such a way as to leave a hollow at the base of the fruit (as often but not invar-
iably occurs with fruits having an elongated base, and as occurs less frequently in
fruits with a blunt base) then one does find a raised torus. Some authors (e.g.
Zhukovsky, 1964; Emboden, i974b; Schultes et al., I974) have characterized the
elongated base of the fruits of wild plants as a "caruncle". This term is ap-
plicable only by analogy, since in botanical usage it refers to a protuberance near
the hilum of a seed (Jackson, I905; Featherly, I965; it may be noted that the
fruits of Cannabis are generally called seeds in common usage.)
Vavilov (I926) accepted Janischevsky's observations concerning the differences
between propagules of wild and cultivated plants of Cannabis, but because
he was well acquainted with the marked intergradation which occurs between
these phases he referred C. ruderalis merely to a variety, var. spontanea,
which he himself had recognized earlier (Vavilov, I922). Cannabis ruderalis
Janischevsky was accepted by a number of Russian authors (e.g. Sukhov, I930;
Yarmolenko, I936). Serebriakova and Sizov (I940) in effect raised the rank of
var. spontanea to that of a subspecies, but did not validly publish the subspecific
combination. Scholz (I957) accepted subsp. spontanea, but did not validate it
nomenclaturally. Scholz' study represents an abbreviated but competent repetition
of Janischevsky's work, dealing with fruit characteristics of wild and cultivated
plants of Europe. Figures 4 and io of Small I975a represent wild material sup-
plied by Scholz (corresponding to E. Small voucher 28).
Vavilov, the father of the Law of Homologous Series (note Vavilov, I949-50),
substantially understood that parallel variation is found between the wild and
domesticated phases of both the southern, high-intoxicant strains, and the northern,
low-intoxicant strains. Vavilov recognized Janischevsky's wild fruit syndrome in
the uncultivated plants he found growing in eastern Afghanistan. He noted the
very small size of fruits of the region, as did Small (I975a). In I929 Vavilov (Va-
vilov and Bukinich, 1929) described "wild" plants of eastern Afghanistan as C.
indica var. kafiristanica. He considered these plants to be characterized vegetat-
ively by their small size, profuse branching, short internodes, and small leaves
with tapered, obovate leaflets. He went on to point out that the plant he had
described in 1926 as C. sativa f. afghanica is actually transitional between his C.
indica var. kafiristanica and domesticated C. indica of India, and he made the
new combination C. indica f. afghanica. (In Fig. 268 of Vavilov and Bukinich's
I929 book the caption is inconsistent with the text in referring to forma kafiris-
tanica and var. afghanica. Clearly the ranks are reversed in the caption. This
error was not corrected in Fig. 167 of a recent reprint of Vavilov's work (Vavilov,
I959).
The best exemplars of the domesticated fruit syndrome among inebriant forms
are found in herbarium specimens collected from ganja (marihuana) fields in In-
dia, before the turn of the century, when domestication of drug strains of Can-
nabis in India reached its zenith (Young et al., I893-94; note cited CAL specimens,
and Fig. 4). Although Cannabis is still widely cultivated for intoxicant properties
in southern countries, the increasing condemnation of it has led to less intensive
continued selection, and, on the whole, intoxicant cultivars are not as fully
domesticated as are fibre cultivars. Nevertheless fruits of most strains used in the
illicit narcotics trade today conform reasonably well to Janischevsky's domestic-

ated syndrome, as do virtually all fibre and oil cultivars. Material collected
outside of cultvation reveals a variety of stages transitional to the wild fruit
syndrome. We interpret the domesticated fruit syndrome in plants collected
outside of cultivation as indicating recent escape from domestication, and we
interpret the transitional stages as reflective of various degrees of progressive
adaptation (or re-adaptation) to exclusively wild existence. These interpretations
are speculative, but not unreasonably so. In conformity with Vavilov's observation
(1926) that the spectrum of variants found in nature for the northern races
represents continuous, transitional variation, Small (I975a) found the same
situation applies to the southern, intoxicant races.
Limitations of Taxonomic Value of Some Characters
Height is only of limited utility as a taxonomic characteristic in Cannabis.
Extreme variation is possible because of environmental modification. Also, short
days initiate flowering, and plants are photoperiodically adapted to terminate
growth in relation to the length of their local growing season. Intensive studies
of ecotypic variation in the U.S.S.R. have indicated that populations from more
northern areas are more easily induced to flower than southern populations, and
accordingly there is a geographic ecocline within subsp. sativa in the U.S.S.R. with
respect to height, the northern forms being shorter than the southern forms (Da-
vidyan, I972).
As noted earlier, agronomic traits (tallness, hollow stems, limited branching)
have been artificially selected, and the introgression of such traits into the wild
phase of Cannabis has resulted in an extraordinary range of morphological variants
(note Nikiforov, I963). Taxonomic delimitation has hitherto been based almost
exclusively on these attributes, and more particularly on the fruit characteristics
detailed earlier. An extensive numerical analysis of numerous attributes of
hundreds of variants of Cannabis grown under standard garden conditions (Small
et al., 1976) failed to suggest taxonomically useful character combinations. At
present we perceive no evidence warranting formal recognition of any taxa
other than the groups we recognize here.
The anatomical differences reported by Anderson (1974) between one stem
collected in Afghanistan and another collected in Kansas require comment. This
finding has been repeatedly represented in courts as so significant as to warrant
almost by itself recognition of separate species. One might indeed expect to find dif-
ferences between the stems of an intoxicant variant (from Afghanistan) and a
fibre variant (from Kansas), but we think that Anderson's limited sampling hardly
suffices to evaluate environmental modification or populational variability. Most
of the anatomical differences that Anderson found are what one might expect
as a result of the long-continued selection of var. sativa for differential rottability
of the stems, and the absence of such selection in subsp. indica. The commercial
fibres of C. sativa are in the phloem. These are extracted at the proper stage of
rotting of the stem, when the phloem fibres are still relatively unaffected, but other
initially firm parts have been softened by rotting. Anderson found that the
libriform fibres of the xylem of what he called C. indica are "typical, lignified
libriform fibres", whereas those of what he called C. sativa "are dimorphic, with
successive tangential bands of thick-walled fibres alternating with bands of thin-
walled fibres. They have irregularly shrunken secondary walls (more pronounced
in the thick-walled fibres) and are termed gelatinous". Accordingly, the fibrous
part of the xylem in the fibre races is disrupted by soft tissue that might be
expected to rot relatively easily. Anderson found that "vessels in C. indica tend
to occur in radial chains; whereas those of C. sativa usually occur singly". Being
separated from each other, the vessels of the fibre races would be more easily
dispersed by rotting of the intervening cells. Anderson also found that the
vessels of "C. indica" have thicker walls than those of "C. sativa". Again, easier
rotting of the fibre races is suggested.

samples of Cannabis than Anderson. He found some of the same differences, and
others as well, but he found that the various features overlap and intergrade so
thoroughly as to preclude their use for taxonomic segregation, and he referred all
variants (including both drug and fibre races) to the single species C. sativa.
In several court cases it has been claimed that the inherent conservativeness of
wood features makes permissible the recognition of species based on any perceived
differences. With regard to the anatomy of the stem of Cannabis, which has been
altered by selection under cultivation, we think that it is the taxonomic evaluation
of the characters, rather than the characters themselves, that should be conserv-
ative. One of us (Small) is now engaged in the study of another species (Daucus
carota L.) in which selection under cultivation has obviously caused great changes
in the anatomical structure of the root.
We recognize that some characters turn out to be taxonomically useful more
often than others, but in each individual case the determination should be made
a posteriori rather than a priori (Linnaeus, I75 , paragraph I69). We have indeed
a fine and generally admitted example of this fact in the leaf arrangement of
Cannabis. Emboden (i974a, altered slightly and published as i974b) endorses
Lamarck's erroneous use of alternate versus opposite leaf arrangement as a means
of distinguishing two putative species. However, the situation with regard to
leaf arrangement in Cannabis was correctly evaluated as far back as 1832, by
Roxburgh, who wrote: "I perfectly agree with Willdenow, in thinking all the
varieties, if even such they can be called, centre in one species. From the same
seed and even on the same plant, I have found the leaves both opposite and
alternate". Although the arrangement of the leaves is often very useful at generic
or suprageneric levels in other groups, the leaves in Cannabis are opposite toward
the base of the stem, and generally alternate toward the top. Helianthus annuus L.,
and a number of other species of Helianthus, show a similar ontogenetic change
in the arrangement of the leaves.
We have found no significant support for the contentions of a number of authors
regarding the taxonomic importance of certain additional characters in Cannabis.
Scholz (I957) indicated ruderal plants have smaller pollen grains than cultivated
plants. However, we found considerable variation in pollen size, and no consistent
differences between ruderal and cultivated plants (even considering material kindly
supplied by Scholz). Indeed, there are presently no morphological characters
known that can be used generally to distinguish wild and cultivated male plants,
and mature females are essential for distinction. Scholz also claimed that the
female inflorescence is more compact in cultivated than in wild plants. This
distinction is, of course, common between wild plants and their cultivated relatives.
Although we have observed many cultivars with distinctly compact inflorescences,
this feature is too variable for consistent diagnosis. We find no support for the
contention of Serebriakova and Sizov (I940) that C. indica has "shinier" fruits
than C. sativa.
Taxonomic Philosophy and Cultivated Plants
The classification of wild progenitor-cultivar-weed complexes has promoted
considerable discussion (e.g. Jirasek, 1966; Baker, I970; Hawkes, 1970; Harlan
and de Wet, I97I; de Wet and Harlan, I975). There is some measure of agreement
on (a) the need to separate the taxonomic treatment of wild-cultivated-weed
complexes from the traditional treatment of strictly wild groups, and on (b) the
general unsuitability of extensive formal infraspecific recognition of variants.
However, there is no consensus on general guidelines for taxonomic disposition.
This situation likely reflects as much the existence of inherent populational
complexity unconducive to simple pigeon-holing, as it does variation in taxonomic
philosophy. Given the range in variational patterns that has been encountered in
wild-cultivated-weed complexes, it seems appropriate to address the nature of
variation per se in given groups, rather than attempt to force all populations into
a universal classification pattern either formal or informal.

characterizing early Soviet plant taxonomy (cf.

debate involving the taxonomy of Cannabis.
Formal Treatment
Our taxonomic treatment of Cannabis consists of
of the two widespread groups based on agronomi
"wild" (sensu lato) and domesticated phase within
inverted the hierarchy, and made the primary group
to growth in cultivation or in the wild, but we chos
indicated below.
Genetic exchanges between cultivated and uncultivated populations occur
wherever Cannabis has been cultivated for any considerable length of time. This
interaction has been documented with regard to the fibre races and their wild
(sensu stricto) or feral correlatives (e.g. Janischevsky, 1924; Vavilov, 1926; Scholz,
I957). Similar interchange between drug races and their wild or feral correlatives
also appears to be extensive. On the other hand, such interaction between drug
and fibre races is more restricted because of geographical separation, occurring
chiefly where both sorts are (or have been) cultivated in proximity. Thus on the
basis of the amount of genetic exchange, it seems advisable to make the primary
infraspecific grouping in accord with what the plants have been cultivated for,
and the secondary one in accord with whether the plants are adapted to growth
in the wild or in cultivation. Fortunately, this arrangement is also in harmony with
social needs and significance. The distinction between drug and fibre races is much
the more important to society.
Distinction at the subspecific rank within C. sativa is carried out by chemical
analysis, knowledge of geographical origin, and possible knowledge of agronomic
use. Outside of smoking the material to evaluate its intoxicant level, which of
course we cannot advocate, there is no simple means of ascertaining by intrinsic

characteristics alone to which subspecies of Cannabis a given plant should be
assigned. It will correctly be pointed out that the recognition of taxa based on such
non-morphological diagnostic attributes represents somewhat of a departure from
traditional plant taxonomy, and that informal treatment might be more in order.
In defense of our treatment we must emphasize the special circumstances of
Cannabis, a fundamentally cultivated plant, where the norms of traditional taxon-
omy require modified application. The distinction we are drawing is one which is
based on the clear existence of two widespread (though not fully differentiated)
kinds of plants that contrast in several non-morphological characteristics. The
distinction is of fundamental economic significance to society, and has been in-
ferred for centuries. Indeed some taxonomists today insist that these variants
be recognized not merely as subspecies but as species. The further distinction we
make into varieties on the basis of adaptation to growth in the wild or in
cultivation is defensible on the same philosophical bases as those supporting the
distinction of Cannabis into the subspecies we recognize, with the added feature
that fairly clear morphological distinction is possible.
It will be appreciated that the four taxa we recognize coexist dynamically by
means of continued natural and artificial selection. A given variant can conceivably
migrate from any given group to any other with appropriate selection and
alteration of genes controlling the critical diagnostic characteristics, and undoubt-
edly such exchanges have occurred and are occurring with some frequency. It is
thus possible for there to be closer affinities between populations of different
varieties than there is between populations of a given variety. The possibility of
such parallelism or "convergence" connotes a measure of artificiality to our taxon-
omic scheme, but no more so, we believe, than is potentially applicable to all
infraspecific taxonomic treatments (cf. Cronquist, 1968, pp. 13-I9).

Diagnosis: Younger, upper leaves of relatively mature plants with less than o.3?/o
(dry weight) A9-THC. Intoxicant cannabinoids generally comprising less than half
of cannabinoids of resin. When dioecious, mature female plants generally with
more than twice as much resin as mature male plants (on relative weight basis,
comparing leaves and flowering parts excluding achenes).
Plants of C. sativa subsp. sativa have limited intoxicant potential. They are
extremely common in North America, Europe, northern Asia, and infrequent
elsewhere except where Cannabis has been cultivated for fibre or oil. Such plants
are typically from areas north of latitude 30? N. (approximately), and when
from such relatively northern areas, are usually phenologically adapted to relat-
ively short periods of vegetative growth before short day length induces sexual
maturity. Most monoecious races have been created by hemp breeders, but
monoecious individuals sometimes also occur in normally dioecious races (see
Holuby, 1878).

P1. 5: 37. I940. (Name intended to cover all cultivated forms of C. sativa L. as
delimited by Serebriakova and Sizov, but not typified and not validly published,
lacking a Latin diagnosis and lacking a reference to a previous diagnosis.)
C. sativa var. praecox Serebr. Trudy Prikl. Bot. I8(I): 410. I928. Name not typified.
Based on a dwarf (2-6 dm), early-flowering form of fibre hemp cultivated in
northeastern U.S.S.R., especially in the province of Archangel.
C. sativa var. monoica Hol. Letop. Matice Slov. I(43): 367. I873. (Based on monoe-
cious plants of Czechoslovakia; cf. Holuby, 1878.). The Holuby specimen from
Slovakia at PRC that is labelled as the type of this variety was collected in 1882.
It may serve to illustrate Holuby's concept, although we do not formally designate
it as a lectotype.
C. generalis Krause in Sturm Fl. Deutsch. Ed. 2. 4: I99. I905. (A superfluous un-
typified name, stated by the author to include C. sativa and C. indica.)
C. americana Houghton and Hamilton, Amer. J. Pharm. 80: i6. 1908. (Name not
validly published; included here only because it has occasionally appeared in
subsequent literature, e.g. C. F. W. Wehmer, Die Pflanzenstoffe, p. 248. 191I).
2 Several names that were not validly published have been included in the synonymy
for the sake of clarity.

Diagnosis: mature fruits usually at least 3.8 mm in length, blunt at the base,
tending to be somewhat persistent at maturity, the perianth adhering poorly and
usually considerably sloughed off.
Plants of C. sativa var. sativa have been domesticated for fibre and/or oil. Fibre
cultivars are usually taller than 3 m in hospitable circumstances (although a
dwarf fibre variant was described by Serebriakova in 1928), and usually are
characterized by long, more or less hollow internodes, and relatively sparse
branching. The leaves are often larger than those of wild plants.
In addition to the cultivated plants, we include in this variety plants which have
recently escaped from cultivation, and which therefore still substantially possess
the attributes of domesticated plants.

Type specimen: Antropova 121, plants grown in I925 at the Kamenna experiment
Station from seeds collected near Saratov in 1921; lectotype here designated,
at WIR.4 Fig. 8.
4 There is a problem with typification of Vavilov's names, since he characteristically
collected seeds or fruits, rather than making herbarium specimens. It may seem irregular
to typify a name on a specimen that did not exist until after the name was published,
but we believe that the circumstances in this instance justify such a procedure. We find
no pre-g922 specimen at the Vavilov Institute (WIR) that could serve as a type. In the
1922 publication, Vavilov specifically referred to the work of his colleague Antropova,
and Saratov was the first locality he mentioned.

Diagnosis: mature fruits usually shorter than 3.8 mm, with persistent mottled
perianth and constricted base, readily disarticulating from the plant at maturity.
This taxon includes indigenous or well-established weedy or naturalized plants
which are either substantially unmodified by domestication represent biotypes
which have undergone considerable de-domestication. This group is highly variable
vegetatively, and is common where Cannabis has been cultivated and/or domestic-
ated for fibre and/or oil properties, notably in North America, Europe, and north-
ern Asia.
Davidyan (1972, p. 25) states that I. Nikiforov in I932 assigned the wild hemp
he found in Kurdistan to C. ruderalis Janisch var. transcaucasica Nikiforov. It ap-
pears, however, that Nikiforov never published this name. C. sativa subsp. sativa
and subsp. indica can be expected to intergrade in Kurdistan, and wild plants of
this region, and of other such geographically intermediate areas, intergrade
between var. spontanea and var. kafiristanica.

Specimens which are more or less intermediate between C. sativa var. sativa and
C. sativa var. spontanea are encountered frequently. Such specimens are especially
common in the United States at present, where Cannabis was widely cultivated up
to and including the early part of this century, with renewed cultivation stimulated
by fibre shortage during the Second World War. It is possible that widespread
escape from cultivation during the second World War occurred, and so much of
the spontaneous Cannabis population of the United States is currently undergoing
de-domestication, and re-acquiring the fruit characteristics of wild plants (cf.
Small, I975a). Sojak (1960) described such intermediate plants as C. intersita
hybr. n. (= C. ruderalis Janisch. X C. sativa L.; cf. Lonachevsky and Kotov 1952,
p. 60.)

Diagnosis: Younger, upper leaves of relatively mature plants with more than
0.3% (dry weight) Δ9-THC. Intoxicant cannabinoids frequently comprising
more than half of cannabinoids of resin. When dioecious, mature female plants with
less than twice as much resin as mature male plants (on relative weight basis,
comparing leaves and flowering parts, excluding achenes).
Plants of C. sativa subsp. indica have considerable intoxicant potential. Plants
of this taxon are typically from areas south of latitude 30? N. (approximately),
and are extremely common in southern Asia, Africa, frequent in central and South
America, and relatively infrequent elsewhere. They are phenologically adapted to
a relatively long period of vegetative growth before short day-length induces
sexual maturity.

C. sativa a kif A. DC. in DC. Prod. i6(i): 30-3I. 1869. (Name indicated by A. DC.
to be of less than varietal, perhaps subvarietal rank; cultivated material from
Algeria & Tunis.)
C. sativa forma afghanica Vavilov Bull. Appl. Bot. Gen. P1. Breed. I6(2): 227. I926.
C. indica var. kafiristanica forma afghanica Vavilov in Vavilov & Bukinich, Zemled.
Afghan. 381. I929. (Kunar River, Afghanistan, between Chekosarai and Jalalabad;
no specimens found at Vavilov Institute, Leningrad. Transitional toward var.
kafiristanica.)
Diagnosis: mature fruits usually at least 3.8 mm in length, blunt at the base, tending
to be persistent at maturity; perianth adhering poorly and usually considerably
sloughed off.
Plants of this variety have been domesticated for intoxicant properties. They
are highly variable vegetatively, but are often shorter than 3 m even in hospitable
environments, often much-branched, often have short internodes, and often have
relatively solid stems in the internodes. They are common in southern Asia, and are
locally grown elsewhere for the narcotics trade.
In addition to the domesticated plants, we include in this variety plants which
have recently escaped from cultivation, and which therefore still substantially
possess the attributes of domesticated plants.

5 Although we have sifted considerable literature, we are unable to find an earlier
validation of this combination than Wehmer (1911). However there is frequent earlier
informal reference to "indica" as a variety, and it is not improbable that the combination
was validly published earlier.

C. indica Lam. var. kafiristanica Vavilov in Vavilov & Bukinich, Zemled. Afghan. 38I.
1929
Type specimen: Vavilov Inst. Herb. # 3952, from seeds sown in 1927 of Vavilov
599, Chekhosara, Afghanistan; a very young plant, illustrated by a half-ton
in the original publication; lectotype here designated, at WIR. Fig. Io.
Diagnosis: mature fruits usually shorter than 3.8 mm, with persistent mottled
perianth and constricted base, readily disarticulating from plants at maturity.
This taxon includes indigenous, or well-established weedy and naturalized
plants, which are either substantially unmodified by domestication or have under
gone considerable de-domestication. They are highly variable vegetatively, and
are common where Cannabis has been cultivated and/or domesticated for
intoxicant properties, notably in southern Asia, and Africa, and to a limited ext
in Mexico, and central and South America. THC content tends to be lower than
in C. sativa var. indica (e.g. Krishnamurty and Kaushal, I974), likely reflect
relaxation for intoxicant ability.
