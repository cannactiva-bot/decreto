Products containing cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids that are not subject to narcotics legislation, Version 8.0, as of 01.05.2025

## 1
## Introduction
Numerous cannabinoid-containing products are available on the Swiss market in terms of
claims, offers and compliance with the legal requirements for the actual intended use of the
products concerned. Thus, for example, products are frequently placed on the market under
chemicals legislation, but are intended for oral administration. Such products only satisfy the
safety requirements for toilet cleaners, etc., but not those for oral administration, for which
they would have to satisfy the legal requirements of food or therapeutic products legislation;
this is the only way of ensuring the safe use of these products.
After several years of the CBD boom, products that are specifically supplemented with other
cannabinoids are increasingly appearing on the market. They are often marketed as smoking
products (e.g. flowers, e-cigarettes), or offered as foods or products for oral administration. The
advertising focuses on health or general well-being.
This information sheet provides an overview of the available raw materials and products containing
CBD and other cannabinoids and their classification and marketability according to the current legal
situation. It is intended primarily as an implementation guide for identifying the competent authorities
and promoting consistent implementation. At the same time, it aims to inform possible suppliers about
the legal requirements that must be followed. The reader is referred to the report “Criteria for
distinguishing therapeutic products from foodstuffs with reference to orally administered products” and
to the guide “Criteria for the demarcation of cosmetic products from therapeutic products and biocidal
products”1 for further information about demarcation.
The implementation guide has been drawn up by the cross-agency Expert Panel for Delimitation
Questions2 (formerly "Technical Platform for Delimitation Issues") with representatives from the
Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO),
Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, the Association of Cantonal Pharmacists
(KAV) and the Association of Swiss Cantonal Chemists (VKCS). Its content will be modified
accordingly as legislation is revised or relevant new scientific findings come to light.

Note:
1. This information sheet applies not only to CBD, but to all cannabinoids of herbal,
synthetic or semi-synthetic origin, provided they are not subject to narcotics legislation. In
this context, the latter refers exclusively to the Narcotics Act (NarcA; SR 812.121) and, for
medical purposes, to the Therapeutic Products Act (TPA; SR 812.21).
2. This information sheet excludes cannabis products with a total THC content of at least
1.0% for medical purposes.
Due to the removal of the prohibition in the Narcotics Act on 1 August 2022, cannabis for
medical purposes with a total THC content of at least 1.0% was reallocated from List d
(prohibited narcotics) to List a (substances subject to all control measures) of the Narcotics
Lists Ordinance (NarcLO-FDHA; SR 812.121.11). As a result, the use of cannabis for medical
purposes with a total THC content of at least 1.0% is subject to regular control measures, like
other controlled substances in List a (see Narcotics Control Ordinance, NarcCO; SR
812.121.1). Cannabis plants and parts thereof as well as preparations such as extracts, resins,
oils and tinctures and the substances dronabinol and THC have also been reallocated to List a,
provided there is an intended medical purpose. The defined limit of at least 1.0% total THC
content remains unchanged.
As a result of the change in the legislation, the cultivation, processing, preparation of and trade
in cannabis for medical purposes were made subject to the approval and control system
operated by Swissmedic, analogously to other narcotics used for medical purposes (such as
fentanyl, methadone and morphine). The handling of cannabis and cannabis products with a
total THC content of at least 1.0% for non-medical purposes is still forbidden (for exceptions
see Art. 8 para. 5 and Art. 8a NarcA).
More information can be found on the Swissmedic and FOPH websites3 4.

## What are cannabinoids?
Cannabinoids are a group of substances that are structurally related to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or
that bind to cannabinoid receptors. The term cannabinoids originally referred to a unique group of
terpene phenol compounds that occur in the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica).
The subsequent development of synthetic cannabinoids, such as dronabinol, has altered this
definition, as has the discovery of endogenous cannabinoids.
Investigations have shown that the cannabis plant produces between 80 and 100 cannabinoids and
around 300 non-cannabinoids. The most important and most thoroughly investigated cannabinoid is
THC. This is the substance responsible for the psychotropic effect of cannabis. Another important
cannabinoid that occurs in large quantities in the plant is CBD. Unlike THC, it does not have any
corresponding comparable psychoactive effect. It interacts with various receptors and evidently also
modulates the psychotropic effect of THC.
The therapeutic potential of CBD or other cannabinoids in most of the numerous applications
circulating on the Internet has either not yet been scientifically demonstrated or, at best, been
demonstrated only inadequately.
## 3
## Legal basis according to classification
The range of products that contain CBD or other cannabinoids (or to which CBD or other
cannabinoids have been added) is extensive. It includes raw materials such as cannabis buds or
powder with a high CBD content, extracts in the form of oils or pastes and ready-to-use products such
as capsules, food supplements, liquids for e-cigarettes, herbal smoking products, scented oils,
chewing gums and ointments, some of which are marketed as personal care products.
Once a product has been assigned to a particular product category, the corresponding Swiss
legislation is applied. If the legal requirements in relation to a specific intended use are not met, a
product may not be distributed in Switzerland and therefore may not be placed on the market.
The final products are classified on a case-by-case basis taking account of all the relevant factors,
including composition, intended use, dosage, etc. The person who places the product on the market
is required to provide information on the intended use (e.g. medicinal product, medical device,
foodstuff, cosmetic, chemical). Different enforcement authorities are responsible for control,
depending on how the products are classified. In case of doubt, the enforcement authority assigns a
product to particular legislation and takes the necessary measures.
Assignment is particularly unclear in the case of products with pure raw materials. Products for which
there is no specific applicable law (e.g. Therapeutic Products Act [TPA; 812.21], Foodstuffs Act
[FoodA; SR 817.0]) are covered by the Federal Act on Product Safety (ProdSA; SR 930.11) (catch-all
legislation).

Raw materials intended for further processing by establishments into final products are subject to the
provisions of the Chemicals Act (ChemA; SR 813.1). All other “raw materials” must be placed on the
market in compliance with the legislation that corresponds to the intended or presumed use.
Other cannabinoids that are not subject to the Narcotics Act, like CBD, must nevertheless satisfy all
the requirements of the legislation or intended use according to which they are to be placed on the
market.
## 4
## Overview of the competent authorities
The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is responsible for the notification of herbal smoking
products and electronic cigarettes and their refill material (liquids) containing CBD and other
cannabinoids in retail packs and for exemptions for cannabis and cannabis products with a THC
content of at least 1.0% without a medical intended use.
If the product is a therapeutic product (medicinal product or medical device), Swissmedic, the Swiss
Agency for Therapeutic Products, is responsible.
The cultivation, processing, preparation of and trade in cannabis for medical purposes with a total
THC content of at least 1.0% is subject to the approval and control system operated by Swissmedic.
The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) is responsible for foodstuffs (including food
supplements), cosmetics and utility articles that come into contact with mucous membranes (e.g.
tobacco- and nicotine-free substitute products for snus containing CBD and other cannabinoids).
The Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) handles issues relating to commercial cultivation in the
agricultural and horticultural production sectors. These are limited to direct payments legislation, plant
health legislation and feed legislation following the revocation with effect from 1 January 2021 of all
the provisions of the agricultural seed legislation governing the production and placing on the market
of hemp seeds and plants.

## In what form are products containing CBD and other cannabinoids
## supplied?
### 5.1
### As a raw material
Raw materials (in the form of substances or preparations) are governed by the provisions of the
chemicals legislation. They are used to prepare products and are therefore typically marketed to
manufacturers. The manufacturers are responsible for correct preparation in compliance with the
specific legal requirements governing their products.
If the intention is to distribute raw materials to the general public, the distributor (who is the
manufacturer under the terms of the Chemicals Ordinance) must exercise self-supervision in
reviewing beforehand the possible and probable uses that could occur.
If this review identifies uses that are subject to special legislation, or if such uses appear plausible, the
requirements of this legislation must be observed.
### 5.2
### As ready-to-use products
Products containing CBD and other cannabinoids are also supplied in ready-to-use form, whether as
therapeutic products, foodstuffs, cosmetics, utility articles (excluding cosmetics), herbal smoking
products or as chemicals, e.g. scented oil. Ready-to-use products or finished products are understood
to be products in the form in which they are supplied directly to the commercial or individual end user
or are designated for them5.
In order to decide which legislation is applicable, it is necessary to consider all the properties and
claims, both implicit and explicit, relating to a product in an overall assessment and to weigh them up
on a case-by-case basis. Some suppliers state on their websites that the products may not be used
for medical purposes for legal reasons. Other websites, on the other hand, include links to sites
describing medical uses of cannabis. Therapeutic claims are evidently being made for such products,
and they are therefore subject to the legislation governing therapeutic products.
The legal requirements for the various product categories and their marketability are described below.
5 This means that they are intended for the "end user" as defined in Article 1 paragraph 5 of the CLP Regulation and may not
be placed on the market in another form.

### Products sold as therapeutic products (medicinal products, medical devices)
5.3.1
Medicinal products
In accordance with Art. 4 para. 1 let. a TPA (SR 812.21), ready-to-use products containing CBD and
other cannabinoids with a medical intended use are regarded as medicinal products and, in
accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 TPA, may not be placed on the market without authorisation.
Establishments which prepare, distribute or dispense medicinal products containing CBD and other
cannabinoids always require a corresponding licence from Swissmedic or the canton in addition.
Epidiolex® was approved by the FDA on 28 June 2018, making it the first CBD monopreparation in
the world to receive regulatory approval. This product was additionally authorised in Switzerland on a
prescription-only basis on 10 February 2021 under the proprietary name Epidyolex®. The following
has to be considered:
•
CBD has a different activity profile from THC and is therefore not suitable as a substitute
for THC;
•
When a medicinal product is approved, its efficacy and safety are only reviewed and
authorised in specific indications. The FDA only approved Epidiolex® for the adjuvant
treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy in 2018; Epidyolex® was authorised in Switzerland
in 2021 for the adjuvant treatment of convulsions associated with Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients from 2 years of age. Further
information on dosage, adverse drug reactions (ADR), extension of the indications, etc.
can be found in the corresponding Information for healthcare professionals6.

In accordance with Art. 9, para. 2 let. a TPA and taking into account the respective provisions of the
legislation governing therapeutic products, medicinal products containing CBD may be prepared and
dispensed in pharmacies. In addition to the general requirements applicable to the preparation,
validation and filling of prescriptions, the following should be considered:
1. A doctor’s prescription must be present.
2. The prescription should be issued by a specialist in the indications for which currently
authorised medicinal products have been approved.
3. If, in justified individual cases, a doctor issues a prescription for a different indication, the
prescription should only be filled (prepared and dispensed) consultation with the respective
doctor and it should be documented accordingly.
If a medicinal product is prepared in a pharmacy using a magistral formula, the following position
papers, which can be found at www.kantonsapotheker.ch must be taken into account:
•
Position paper 0021 Cannabis medicinal products (current version)
•

5.3.2
Medical devices
Products containing CBD and other cannabinoids with a medical intended use, the primary effect of
which in or on the human body according to its intended use is not achieved by pharmacological,
immunological or metabolic means, but the mode of action of which is supported by the CBD or other
cannabinoids contained in the product, may comply with the definition of a medical device as
stipulated in Art. 3 of the Medical Devices Ordinance (MedDO; SR 812.213).
The classification of medical devices containing CBD and other cannabinoids is guided by Art. 15
MedDO in conjunction with Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices (EU-MDR).
If multiple classification rules apply to a device, the strictest rule applies, meaning that the device will
be placed into the highest applicable class.
For medical devices containing CBD or other cannabinoids, classification rules 14 and 21 of Annex
VIII EU-MDR must also be taken into particular account. The two classification rules listed here are
not exhaustive7.
Medical devices may generally contain plant extracts which provide colour or flavour, for example. In
all cases in which medical devices may contain pharmacologically active substances or plant extracts,
the manufacturer must perform a case-by-case assessment of whether the product must be classified
as a medicinal product or a medical device and, if it is a medical device, the class to which it belongs.
This also applies to CBD or other cannabinoids since these may have a pharmacological, if not a
psychoactive, effect.
Art. 45 para. 2 TPA and Art. 21 para. 2 MedDO require anyone who places a medical device on the
market (e.g. manufacturers or importers) to perform an assessment of and/or be able to demonstrate
conformity with the fundamental safety and performance requirements (more detailed information on
the obligations of economic operators can be found in the information sheet “Obligations Economic
Operators CH8”).
The conformity assessment procedure is based on Articles 52 and 54 and Annexes IX-XI EU-MDR
(Art. 23 MedDO), the necessary certificate(s) on Annexes IX-XI EU-MDR (Art. 25 para.1 MedDO) and
the declaration of conformity on Annex IV EU-MDR (Art. 29 para. 2 MedDO).

### 5.4
### Products sold as foodstuffs
Art. 4 para. 1 of the Foodstuffs Act (FoodA; SR 817.0) defines foodstuffs as any substances or
products that are intended for consumption by, or that can reasonably be expected to be consumed
by, humans in processed, partially processed or unprocessed form. Medicinal products, narcotics and
psychotropic substances are not regarded as foodstuffs (Art. 4 para. 3 FoodA).
It is a basic precondition that foodstuffs must be safe (Art. 7 FoodA). This means that they may be
neither harmful to health nor unsuitable for consumption by humans (Art. 8 of the Ordinance on
Foodstuffs and Utility Articles [FUAO; SR 817.02]).
However, foodstuffs that were not used for human consumption to a significant degree prior to 15 May
1997, either in Switzerland or in a member state of the EU, must be licensed by the FSVO or
authorised by the European Commission. These foodstuffs are classed as novel foods (Art. 15
FUAO), a category that includes cannabinoids such as CBD and extracts of Cannabis sativa L. and
derivatives containing cannabinoids that are used in/as foodstuffs (e.g. hemp seed oil with added
CBD, food supplements with CBD).
Products derived from Cannabis sativa L. or from parts of the plant which were documented as safe
and in use for human consumption to a significant degree in the EU prior to 15 May 1997 are not
considered to be novel foodstuffs in Switzerland provided the plant Cannabis sativa L. fulfils the
requirements of Art. 15 para. 1 let. d no. 2 FUAO. This applies in particular to hemp seeds, hemp
seed oil, hemp seed flour and defatted hemp seeds. Furthermore, in Switzerland herbal tea obtained
from the leaves of the cannabis plant Cannabis sativa L. is not considered to be a novel foodstuff. The
latter may be used to flavour foodstuffs without a licence. The precondition for this is that the herbal
tea is used as an aqueous infusion and in no other form (e.g. concentrated or as a syrup).
As part of the authorisation procedure for novel foodstuffs, the FSVO checks whether the product is
safe and not deceptive (Art. 3 para. 1 FUAO). A basic precondition for authorisation is that the product
is classified as a foodstuff and is not subject to therapeutic products legislation (Art. 2 para. 4 let. d
FoodA).
If they are subject to food legislation, products with cannabinoids added as pure substances may not
currently be placed on the market. Such products are subject to the Novel Food Regulation (Art. 15-
19 FUAO). To date, no such products have been authorised as Novel Foods. Unregulated or
unapproved novel foods may neither be placed on the market (Art. 16 FUAO) nor used as food
ingredients (Art. 18 FUAO).
To date numerous applications have already been submitted in the EU for CBD to be authorised as a
novel foodstuff. The European Commission has passed on these applications to the EFSA for
assessment of the harmlessness to health of the consumption of CBD by humans. The Scientific
Committee of the EFSA identified numerous gaps in the data concerning the impact on health of
consuming CBD. Assessment of CBD as a novel foodstuff will therefore be suspended in the EU until
these data gaps have been filled by the applicants.
Switzerland has also assessed the health risks of CBD as a novel foodstuff and published the findings
in the “FSVO Briefing Letter: Cannabidiol (CBD) in foodstuffs and effects on the liver” dated

### Expert Panel for Delimitation Questions
Products containing cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids that are not subject to narcotics legislation, Version 8.0, as of 01.05.2025
12 / 21
3 December 2021. Safety concerns exist in Switzerland too, and it is currently not possible to produce
a final assessment of the safety of CBD as a foodstuff.
The Ordinance on the Maximum Levels of Contaminants (ContO; SR 817.022.15) is also relevant to
cannabis-containing foodstuffs, since it regulates the maximum permitted levels of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in food products.
The presence of CBD or other cannabinoid is indicated on the labelling of a product derived from
Cannabis sativa L. by means of the word "contains...". Depending on the specific case, this word and
others with the same meaning may be considered as nutritional or health-related information or an
indication of the presence of an ingredient in a product.
If this indication is considered to be nutritional information, it must fulfil the conditions for use of the
information “contains...” described in Annex 13 of the FDHA Ordinance on Information on Foodstuffs
(FoodIO; RS 817.022.16).
In order to use information of this type for a cannabinoid such as CBD contained in the ingredient
Cannabis sativa, it must be possible to demonstrate that a quantity of the corresponding cannabinoid
sufficient to produce the nutritional effect established by generally accepted scientific evidence is
present in the product (Art. 29 para. 2 let. b no. 2 FoodIO).
This indication could equally be considered to be non-specific health information, for example if it is
present in combination with certain graphic elements. According to Art. 34 para. 2 FoodIO,
information of this type is only permitted if it is accompanied by authorised health-related information
in keeping with Art. 31 para. 3 FoodIO, or by health-related information as described in Annex 14
FoodIO. No health-related information is currently permitted for cannabinoids such as CBD. It is
therefore currently prohibited to indicate the presence of a cannabinoid if this is considered to be
health-related information.
If it is not considered to be either nutritional information or health-related information, it could be
considered as an indication of the presence of an ingredient in the product. Since no cannabinoid is
currently authorised as an ingredient in foodstuffs (novel foodstuff), it is not possible at
present to indicate the presence of cannabinoids such as CBD in this way.

### 5.5
### Products sold as cosmetics
General requirements for cosmetics:
A cosmetic product (cf. definition in Art. 53 para. 1 FUAO) must be safe (Art. 15 FoodA). The safety of
the individual ingredients must be documented in a safety report (Art. 57 FUAO). Furthermore,
references of any kind to effects of cosmetics that lead to the cure, relief or prevention of diseases
(e.g. medical or therapeutic properties) are forbidden (Art. 47 para. 3 FUAO).
Specific requirements with respect to CBD and other cannabinoids:
Based on the report from the Federal Council on legal certainty regarding the production, trade in and
use of hemp/cannabis products,9 the interpretation on the use of CBD and other cannabinoids in
cosmetics is being modified.
Currently, CBD and other cannabinoids are not specifically regulated as such. However, the use of
“narcotics” in cosmetic products is prohibited under Art. 54 para. 1 FUAO with reference to Regulation
(EC) 1223/200910. According to entry no. 306 of Annex II of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 "narcotics"
are defined as follows:
“Narcotics, natural and synthetic: All substances listed in Tables I and II of the Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs11 signed in New York on 30 March 1961”. "Cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabis
extracts and cannabis tinctures" are listed in this Table I.
However, the Single Convention is not directly applicable (not “self-executing”). Furthermore, the EU
legislation does not further specify the Single Convention; rather, it permits the member states to
implement the regulations into national law (no uniform interpretation).
Therefore, Switzerland has adopted the Single Convention under its national narcotics legislation.
“Cannabis” 12  is defined in Annex 1 NarcLO-FDHA. Of relevance is the total THC content of at least
1.0%, regardless of whether CBD or other cannabinoids were obtained from the flowers or leaves of
the hemp plant.
For the manufacture of CBD or other cannabinoids for use in cosmetic products, it is irrelevant which
part of the hemp plant is used. Rather, none of the intermediate products during the entire
manufacturing process can have a THC content of more than 1.0%.

1.0%.
With regard to cannabis resin, cannabis extracts and cannabis tinctures, reference is made to the definition of cannabis.

Synthetic CBD and other synthetic cannabinoids are not specifically regulated either. The general
legal requirements for cosmetics described above apply.
Furthermore, the safety report to be created for self-supervision (Art. 57 FUAO) must include scientific
evidence that the CBD or other cannabinoids, regardless of origin, used to manufacture the cosmetic
products do not pose a risk to health and are safe.
A product with a total THC content of 1.0% or higher is subject to the provisions of narcotics
legislation.
Following the approval of the general ruling of the Notification Authority for Chemicals of 29 March
2022 on the denaturing of CBD-containing scented oils as chemicals and the recent suspension of the
assessment of CBD as a novel foodstuff in the EU, numerous CBD oils are currently being offered on
the market as oral care products containing various concentrations of CBD. Products of this kind do
not comply with the intended use of a cosmetic and there is considerable potential for misuse.
It is currently not possible to perform an adequate safety assessment of these products. To date, the
safety has not been demonstrated in any of the safety reports available to the cantonal enforcement
authorities: gaps in the data mean that precisely the same safety concerns exist as those relating to
foodstuffs. The placing on the market of such a product for oral administration does not currently
satisfy the legal requirements.

### Products sold as utility articles (e.g. tobacco- and nicotine-free substitute
### products for snus)
Some relevant shops offer non-smoked tobacco substitutes containing CBD and other cannabinoids
(e.g. substitute products for snus). These are classified as utility articles. According to Art. 5 FoodA,
these are defined as articles that come into contact with mucous membranes. According to Art. 61
FUOA, articles that come into contact with the oral mucosa when used correctly or in the normally
expected manner may only release substances in quantities that pose no risk to health.
Substances that confer pharmacological effects on products may not be added (Art. 61 para. 2
FUAO). Accordingly, it is not permitted to add CBD and other cannabinoids to such products in
pharmacologically effective doses. This also applies to information which suggests that the product is
a therapeutic product.

### Products sold as chemicals
The Chemicals Act primarily regulates the packaging and labelling of chemical products. Before
placing chemical products on the market, the responsible manufacturer is required to practice self-
supervision as regards conformity with chemicals legislation. However, if in the course of self-
supervision the presentation of a product is suggestive of or implies uses that would be covered by
other legal provisions, its marketability must be assessed according to these provisions (see Art. 1
para. 5 let. c Chemicals Ordinance, ChemO; SR 813.11).
Example: CBD-containing "scented oil" is sold in a refill container for e-cigarettes: in this case tobacco
product legislation, not chemicals legislation, forms the basis for the assessment of the product’s
marketability (see following section). However, for the purposes of practical marketing, marketable
refill containers of this kind must be labelled and notified in accordance with both tobacco product and
chemicals legislation. Further examples could include cannabis oils and cannabis tinctures which are
sold without a medical prescription but with the intention of using them orally in the expectation of a
pharmacological effect, in which case the therapeutic products legislation would apply.
If the product is subject to the provisions of the ChemO, the manufacturer must assess whether the
chemical product may pose a threat to the life or health of humans or the environment. Accordingly,
the manufacturer must classify, package and label the product in accordance with the provisions of
ChemO and produce a safety data sheet. On 29 March 2022 the Common Notification Authority for
Chemicals issued a general ruling requiring CBD-containing products placed on the market under the
provisions of the chemicals legislation and intended for the end consumer to be denatured. This
affects, for example, products with barely plausible product claims such as "to fragrance rooms", but
not CBD intended for consumption as a foodstuff (see section "Products sold as foodstuffs"),
therapeutic products (see section "Products sold as therapeutic products (medicinal products, medical
devices)"), cosmetics (see section "Products sold as cosmetics"), liquids for e-cigarettes (see section
"Products sold as herbal smoking products, as well as electronic cigarettes and their refill material
(liquids)") or products sold as utility items (e.g. tobacco- and nicotine-free substitute products for
snus).

### Products sold as herbal smoking products as well as electronic cigarettes
### and their refill material (liquids)
Since the new Tobacco Products Act entered into force on 1 October 2024, the previous food
legislation requirements no longer apply to tobacco products.13 In the new tobacco products
legislation, smoked herbal products and electronic cigarettes and their refill material (liquids) are
regulated in the Tobacco Products Act (TobPA; SR 818.32) and the Tobacco Products Ordinance
(TobPO; SR 818.321). Cannabis with a total THC content of less than 1.0% is not regarded as having
a psychotropic effect and can now be sold as a herbal smoking product. Furthermore, the addition of
CBD to electronic cigarettes and refill liquids is generally permitted. The person or entity placing the
product on the market must practise self-regulation (Art. 25 TobPA and Art. 21 to 24 TobPO) and
must notify the products to the FOPH within one year after placing them on the market (Art. 26 and 27
TobPA and Art. 25 to 27 TobPO). The product notifications, including corresponding evidence and
documents, should now be submitted digitally on the website www.tabacinfo.ch
In addition to the requirements of TobPO, refill containers for e-cigarettes must also satisfy those of
the Chemicals Ordinance (Art. 24 and 27 TobPO), particularly as regards labelling and the notification
in the Chemicals Register (RPC), which is automatically transmitted from Tabacinfo. Claims for
tobacco products that create misconceptions about effects on health are prohibited (Art. 5 para. 2
TobPA). Responsibility for checking compliance lies with the competent enforcement bodies in the
cantons.
The use of cannabis products with a low THC content may temporarily impair the ability to drive. A
corresponding warning was therefore incorporated into Art. 14 para. 1 let. c point 3 of the Tobacco
Products Act. Consumers may also face prosecution abroad because of stricter regulations and
different threshold values for THC in cannabis products. The FOPH therefore recommends persons or
entities placing products on the market to voluntarily inform consumers. Details can be found on the
FOPH website linked below and in the Classified compilation of Swiss federal legislation (on the
linked site under Laws) (in the Swiss languages only).

13 Tobacco- and nicotine-free substitute products for snus containing CBD and other cannabinoids are utility articles that
come into contact with mucous membranes continue to be subject to food legislation (see section "Products sold as utility
articles (e.g. tobacco- and nicotine-free substitute products for snus)”).

### Agricultural production of hemp, hemp seeds and plants
Agricultural production of hemp that is not classified as a narcotic has been permitted since 1 January
2021. All the provisions of the seed legislation governing the production and placing on the market of
hemp seeds and plants have been revoked. The provisions of the plant health legislation and the
direct payments legislation must be observed with respect to the agricultural production of hemp. If
the hemp is intended for use as animal feed, the provisions of the feed legislation apply.

### Procedure for cannabis and cannabis preparations containing CBD and other
### cannabinoids with a total THC content of less than 1.0%
According to NarcLO-FDHA, cannabis and cannabis preparations with a total THC content of less
than 1.0% are not regarded as narcotics, and the exemptions in accordance with Art. 8 para. 5 NarcA
therefore do not apply. Authorisation from the FOPH is therefore not required to handle cannabis with
a total THC content of less than 1.0% or cannabis preparations made from hemp with a total THC
content of less than 1.0%.
According to Art. 8 para. 5 and para. 8 NarcA, the FOPH can issue exemptions for the cultivation,
import, preparation and placing on the market of banned narcotics if there is no international
agreement to prevent it from doing so and the narcotics in question are intended for scientific
research, medicinal product development, limited medical use or control measures. Following the
revision of the Narcotics Act on 1 August 2022, cannabis with a total THC content of at least 1.0% for
medical purposes is no longer classified as a prohibited narcotic and is now subject to the approval
and control system operated by Swissmedic (see Art. 8 para. 1 let. d NarcA in conjunction with List a
of NarcLO-FDHA). You can find further information at the link below.
### 5.11
### Import and export of cannabis and cannabis preparations containing CBD
### and other cannabinoids with a total THC content of less than 1.0%
Swissmedic cannot issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the import or export of cannabis or
cannabis preparations with a total THC content of less than 1.0% since these substances or products
are subject to the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
To comply with the narcotics legislation, importers are required to prove that the products they intend
to import have a total THC content of less than 1.0%. Corresponding proof in the form of a batch-
specific certificate of analysis for the delivery in question issued by a laboratory accredited to ISO/IEC
17025 or by a GMP laboratory must be provided.
