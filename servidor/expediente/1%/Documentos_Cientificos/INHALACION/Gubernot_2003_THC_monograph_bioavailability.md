What is Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol?

 Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol   is also
  called cannabinol, cannabis, and THC
 THC is the chemical responsible for
  most of the pharmocological and
  pyschological effects in marijuana
 It is derived from the Cannabis sativa
  plant
Where THC is Encountered

 Historically: used as a medicine in the
  19th century, in the form of marijuana
 Marijuana became a Schedule I
  controlled substance in 1970.
 Currently, THC found in:
    – Marijuana (Widely used)
    – Synthetic therapeutics (Dronabinol)
Chemical & Physical Properties

 Solid
 Highly lipophilic and water insoluable
 Molecular formula: C12H30O2
 Molecular Weight: 314.45
Exposure
 Exposure    is primarily deliberate
 Marijuana
  – Inhalation (including second-hand smoke)
  – Oral ingestion (e.g. marijuana brownies)
  – THC content in marijuana varies from .5-
    11%; a typical “joint” is about 2-3%.
 Therapeutic   capsules, Dronabinol
  - Oral ingestion
Toxicokinetics
   Inhalation:
    – Rapidly delivered to lungs
    – Efficient absorption into bloodstream
    – System bioavailability ranges 10-35%
   Oral Ingestion:
    –   Absorption is low and erratic
    –   Degraded by stomach acid
    –   Liver metabolism also reduces the bioavailability
    –   Bioavailability ranges 4-14%
   Multi-compartment toxicokinetic model
Dose-Response
   When smoked: Maximum plasma
    concentration achieved within minutes
    – Psychotropic effects start in seconds or minutes,
      reach a maximum at 15-30 min. and taper off
      within 2-3 hours
   Orally: psychotropic effects set in with a delay
    of 30-90 min., reach maximum after 2-3 hours
    and last for 4-12 hours
   Dose dependent
   Acts on cannabinoid receptors in the brain
Distribution
   THC in blood: 90% plasma, 10% Red Blood
    Cells (RBCs)
   Almost 99% of THC in plasma is bound to
    proteins
   THC rapidly penetrates highly vascularized
    tissue
   Low concentrations in the brain probably due
    to rate of moving in and out
   Stored in fatty tissues
Metabolism

 Mainly  metabolized in the liver via
  cytochrome P450 enzyme
 Some metabolism in heart and lung
 THC is rapidly converted to 11-hydroxy-
  delta-9-THC, which produces the same
  effects as the parent compound
 11-OH-THC stays in the brain, which
  contributes to the effects of THC
Elimination

 Slow   due to re-diffusion from fat
 Half-life reported at 20-30 hours & 49-
  53 hours
 Metabolites bound in plasma and slowly
  excreted
    Excretion
    THC excreted mainly as acid metabolites
    15-30% in urine
    30-65% in feces
    Also detected in breast-milk
    Urine detection: 2 to 19 days, depending on
     the dosage
    Excretion delayed by enterohepatic re-
     circulation
    Passive smoke: detection in urine???
                  Not at normal cut-offs

Toxicity & Carcinogenicity
   There is no defined toxic threshold
   “High” effects require a dose of about 5ug/kg
   LD50 in rats/mice is extremely high
     – 800-1900 mg/kg in rats
     – CNS depression           Death
     – LD50 in monkeys and dogs unattainable at very
       high doses
   non-fatal consumption by the dog and monkey is
    equal to a human eating 46 pounds of 1% marijuana
    or 10lbs of 5% hashish at one time
   No acute toxicity at usual doses consumed by
    humans
   No reports of fatalities due to “overdose” of marijuana
Toxicity & Carcinogenicity
 Unlikely that there is a teratogenic risk
  (birth defects)
 Potential for high doses triggering a
  myocardial infarction in susceptible
  individuals
 No reports of THC being carcinogenic
 Mixed reports about marijuana causing
  cancer
Health Outcomes: Immediate Effects
 Impaired short-term memory
 Dry mouth
 Distorted perception
 Euphoric feeling
 Impaired judgment and complex motor
  skills
 Tachycardia (increased heart rate)
 Anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, and
  lethargy at higher doses
Health Outcomes: Long-term Effects

 Possible   adverse effects on:
  – Reproductive system
  – Endocrine system
  – Immune system
  – Synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins
 Respiratory
           illnesses (associated with
 smoking marijuana)
Health Outcomes - Marijuana

 Deposits  4x as much tar in the lungs as
  one tobacco cigarette
 Cellular changes in lung are possible
  pre-cursors of lung cancer
 No evidence that smoking while
  pregnant effects the fetus
 Marijuana use produces a profound
  tolerance, and possible dependence
Other Outcomes – Marijuana Use
   Societal costs:
    –   Drug-related auto wrecks
    –   Property damage
    –   Truancy and school failure
    –   Drug-related crimes
   Occupational Issues:
    –   Drug-related accidents
    –   Increased absences & tardiness
    –   Worker Compensation claims
    –   Lost productivity
Treatment

 No antidote for THC
 Therapy for Marijuana Use:
  – Counseling
  – Support-groups
  – Drug-Rehab
 Drug   Use Prevention
    Biomarkers
    THC metabolites can be detected in the
     plasma, urine, hair and saliva
    Plasma and saliva screen detect only very
     recent use ( 4-12 hours)
    Urine screens most widely used
    –   Detects recent use (approx. one week)
    –   Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay
    –   50ng/mL cut-off
    Very unlikely that second-hand smoke be
     detected in a urine screening test
    Special Issues – The Medical Debate
   Studies show marijuana is an effective:
     – Antiemetic
     – Anticonvulsant
     – Appetite stimulant
     – Analgesic
     – Muscle relaxant
     – Also useful for treating: glaucoma, asthma, migraines
     – Potentially useful for chronic pain
   Effects the Central Nervous System by
    suppressing neural impulses
   Long-term medical use shows no physical or
    cognitive effects
    Regulation
   FDA Approved Dronabinol (brand name
    Marinol) prescribed to chemotherapy
    patients
    – 1999 IOM Report states patients prefer smoking
      marijuana to dronabinol since it is faster acting
      and the dose is easier to control
   Marijuana: Controlled Substance Act Schedule I
    drug
    – Considered to have no medical use
   THC: Schedule I and II drug
    – Has a medical use
