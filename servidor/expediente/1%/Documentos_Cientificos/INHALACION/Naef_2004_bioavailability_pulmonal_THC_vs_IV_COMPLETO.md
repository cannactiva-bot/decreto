ABSTRACT:
The aim of the present study was to develop a physiologically compatible
inhalation solution of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and to compare the pharma-
cokinetic and analgesic properties of pulmonal THC versus pulmonal placebo and
intravenous (iv) THC, respectively. Eight healthy volunteers were included in this
randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The aqueous THC formulations were prepar-
ed by using a solubilization technique. iv THC (0.053 mg/kg body weight), pulmonal THC
(0.053 mg/kg), or a placebo inhalation solution was administered as single dose. At
deﬁned time points, blood samples were collected, and somatic and psychotropic side
effects as well as vital functions monitored. An ice water immersion test was performed to
measure analgesia. Using a pressure-driven nebulizer, the pulmonal administration of
the THC liquid aerosol resulted in high THC peak plasma levels within minutes. The
bioavailability of the pulmonal THC was 28.7  8.2% (mean  SEM). The side effects
observed after pulmonal THC were coughing and slight irritation of the upper respiratory
tract, very mild psychotropic symptoms, and headache. The side effects after iv THC were
much more prominent. Neither pulmonal nor iv THC signiﬁcantly reduced experimen-
tally induced pain.  2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm

INTRODUCTION
Numerous indications for cannabis preparations
and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have
been postulated, with marked differences in the
available supporting data. For applications such
as nausea and vomiting associated with cancer
chemotherapy, anorexia, and cachexia in HIV/
AIDS, and spasticity in multiple sclerosis and
spinal cord injury, there is strong evidence for
medical
beneﬁts.1–4
Relatively
well-conﬁrmed
effects were described related to painful condi-
tions, especially neurogenic pain, movement dis-
orders, asthma, and glaucoma.1 In folk medicine,
cannabis is widely used to relieve pain of differ-
ent origins, such as back pain, headache, and
migraine.5 Few human trials have been con-
ducted so far and the outcomes were equivocal.6
Fifteen to twenty milligrams of oral THC reduced
cancer pain signiﬁcantly, with 20 mg of THC
corresponding
to
120
mg
of
oral
codeine.7,8
Intravenous (iv) THC did not affect pain tolerance
in dental surgical pain.9 Analgesia could not be

conﬁrmed in a previous pain study with healthy
subjects using oral THC (dronabinol, Marinol1)
and experimental pain models.10 Extensive ﬁrst-
pass metabolism by the liver was observed lead-
ing to early and high THC metabolite plasma
levels. Additionally, the THC plasma peak con-
centrations showed a high interindividual var-
iability
between
30
and
120
min.10
The
bioavailability of orally administered THC is
known to be low (6–20%) and to depend on the
vehicle and co-ingested food.11 The peak plasma
levels, occurring at 1–5 h after administration,
show a strong, also vehicle- and food-dependent
variability.11 After eating cannabis cookies, the
bioavailability of THC was 6%,12 whereas when
using THC dissolved in sesame oil in soft gelatin
capsules, it was 11 (women) to 19% (men).13
These factors make it very difﬁcult to dose oral
THC. There is a need for alternative application
forms with better pharmacokinetic properties.
Ohlsson et al.12 studied the pharmacokinetic
behavior of THC and its clinical effects after iv
administration, oral ingestion of cannabis cookies,
and smoking cannabis cigarettes. Plasma levels
after smoking and iv injection were similar, but
low and irregular after ingestion. Peak plasma
levels after smoking occurred rapidly and the bio-
availability was found to be much higher (18–50%)
than after oral (6–20%) administration.11,12 For a
rapid onset of action, the United States Institute of
Medicine recommended the development of reli-
able, and safe THC delivery systems for clinical
trials with cannabinoid drugs for symptom man-
agement.14 To the best of our knowledge, there are
neither pharmacokinetic data of pulmonally admi-
nistered THC in humans, except for smoked
cannabis, nor data from cannabis-naı¨ve subjects.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
develop and validate in vitro and in vivo a
physiologically tolerable inhalation solution that
could be administered with a commercially avail-
able nebulizer. In addition, this new application
form should be easy to handle, lead to a higher
bioavailability as well as early peak plasma levels
of THC, and consequently show a rapid onset of
action.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
The clinical test compound THC (dronabinol) was
supplied by THC Pharm GmbH (Frankfurt am
Main, Germany). Cremophor1 RH 40 was pro-
vided from BASF AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany);
all other chemicals were of pharmaceutical qual-
ity obtained by the pharmacy of the University
Hospital of Bern. THC and THC-d3 used for
plasma analysis were obtained from Lipomed
(Arlesheim, Switzerland), and ()-11-hydroxy-
D9-THC (11-OH-THC), ()-11-hydroxy-D9-THC-
d3 (11-OH-THC-d3), ()-11-nor-9-carboxy-D9-THC
(11-COOH-THC),
and
()-11-nor-9-carboxy-D9-
THC-d3 (11-COOH-THC-d3) were from Radian
(Austin, TX). All solvents were of high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and
purchased either from Merck (Basel, Switzerland)
or Fluka Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland). Bac-
terial
b-glucuronidase
(Escherichia
coli,
type
IX-A) and N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) triﬂuoraceta-
mide (BSTFA) containing 1% trimethylsilyl chlor-
ide (TMCS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Buchs, Switzerland) and Fluka Chemie, re-
spectively. The solid phase extraction columns
(Bakerbond SPE octadecyl cartridges) were pur-
chased from Stehelin (Basel, Switzerland). Roche
OnTrak TesTstiks (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland) with a cut-off of 50 ng/mL were used
for urine cannabis testing.
Subjects and Study Design
Eight healthy, cannabis-naı¨ve, nonsmoking vol-
unteers (four women, aged 26–35 years, body
weight 60  8 kg; four men, 27–50 years, 80 
5 kg) were accepted for this randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, crossover study which
was performed at the Clinical Investigation Unit
of the University Hospital of Bern. The subjects
were informed about the risks of the study, gave
their written informed consent, and were paid
for participating. Exclusion criteria were past or
existing drug abuse (including alcohol and pre-
scription drugs; cannabis urine test before each
session), pregnancy (urine test before ﬁrst session),
positive past history of any psychiatric disorders,
and lung diseases. Each subject had to pass lung
function tests including vital capacity and forced
expiratory volume in 1 s. The subjects were not
allowed to take analgesics, alcohol, and caf-
feinated beverages 48 h before and during the
study and were asked to refrain from driving up to
24 h after the end of the study. The study was
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee,
the
Swiss
Agency
for
Therapeutic
Products
(Swissmedic), and the Swiss Federal Ofﬁce for
Public Health. In the ﬁrst and second session, each

subject received randomly and double-blinded
either the THC (0.053 mg/kg body weight) or the
placebo inhalation aerosol. In the third session,
THC was administered iv (0.053 mg/kg body
weight)
over
a
time
period
of
2
min.
The
between-session washout phases were at least
7 days. To familiarize the subjects with the pain
test and visual analog scales (VAS), each session
began with a training phase, during which the
subjects performed a pain test and a 5-min
inhalation training with the placebo aerosol. This
was followed by recording the baseline of vital
functions, side effect scores (VAS), and pain test.
After administration of the THC and placebo
preparations, vital functions and side effects were
recorded and ice water pain determined at 20, 40,
60, 120, 240, and 480 min. Blood (5 mL per time
point, corresponding to 45 mL per session, and
135 mL per study) was collected in all three
sessions through a peripheral venous catheter
from a forearm vein at baseline, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60,
120, 240, and 480 min after administration of the
test medications. The heparinized blood samples
were centrifuged and the plasma instantly deep-
frozen and stored at 208C until analysis.
Preparation and Validation of the
Test Medications
The THC inhalation solution consisted of 0.3% (w/
v) of THC, 5.0% (w/v) Cremophor1 RH 40, 1.0%
(v/v) benzyl alcohol, 0.05% (w/v) sodium ascor-
bate, and 84.2 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
7.4). THC and Cremophor1 RH 40 were heated in
a water bath at 638C for 10 min. Two-third of the
phosphate buffer, also heated at 638C, was then
incorporated in the mixture by shaking. After
cooling to room temperature, benzyl alcohol,
sodium ascorbate, and the remaining phosphate
buffer were added to the mixture. The clear,
yellowish solution was then sonicated for 30 s and
ﬁnally ﬁltrated through a 0.22-mm ﬁlter under
aseptic conditions. The placebo inhalation solu-
tion was prepared like the THC solution. The
THC content and the stability of THC in the
inhalation solution, stored at 48C and protected
from light, was controlled by HPLC with diode
array detection (HPLC-DAD). The THC content
had to be within a range of 5% of the initial
value. Osmolality, viscosity, pH, and sterility
were measured according to the standards of the
European Pharmacopeia.15 For the in vitro vali-
dation of the nebulizer system and the liquid
aerosol, the pressure-driven PARI1 Master appa-
ratus (Labhardt, Basel, Switzerland) was con-
nected to the tubing followed by the interrupter
and the PARI1 LC-Plus nebulizer equipped with
an inspiratory valve. The nebulizer itself was
connected to a PARI1 ﬁlter set containing a ﬁlter
pad collecting the aerosol. The ﬁlter set was then
connected to a 3-L calibration hand pump (3-L
Calibrated Syringe; Sensor Medics Corporation,
Yorba Linda, CA). Samples of 2 and 3 mL
(n ¼ 3 each) were nebulized. The inhalation was
simulated manually with the hand pump (velocity
1 pull/10 s). The aerosol absorbed on the ﬁlter pad
was then extracted with ethanol, lyophilized,
redissolved in ethanol, and analyzed by HPLC-
DAD. The particle size distribution was de-
termined by using a Malvern Mastersizer X
equipped with a 100-mm lens and Malvern Soft-
ware, Malvern, UK (using the algorithm for
volume distribution, polydisperse aerosol, and
the 2QAA-model representing water in air). To
minimize light scattering, the room was darkened
during
the
measurements.
Temperature
and
humidity were kept constantly at 238C and 40%,
respectively. For the sample analysis, the inhala-
tion solution was nebulized continuously into the
laser beam and
continuously removed
by a
vacuum cleaner. The obscuration was held on a
value of approximately 10–30%. The particle size
distribution was measured in the vehicle (n ¼ 10)
and in the THC liquid aerosol (n ¼ 5). The
injection solution consisted of 0.1% (w/v) of THC,
1.5% (w/v) Tween1 80, 5.0% (v/v) ethanol abso-
lute, 0.1% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, and sodium
chloride solution (0.9%).16 Sodium ascorbate was
added
to
prevent
the
oxidation
of
THC
to
cannabinol. THC was dissolved in ethanol and
Tween1 80, then added to the sodium ascorbate
dissolved in 1 mL of the sodium chloride solution.
The remaining sodium chloride solution was
ﬁnally added to the mixture. The clear, yellowish
solution was then sonicated for 30 s and ﬁltrated
through a 0.22-mm ﬁlter under aseptic conditions.
Inhalation Procedure
The pressure-driven inhalation device PARI1
Master and the PARI1 LC-plus nebulizer with
interrupter
were
used.
The
subjects
were
instructed to inhale deeply with a breath fre-
quency of 1 breath per 10 s waiting for 3–5 s
before expiration. The subjects were instructed to
continue until all the inhalation solution had been
inhaled. Inhalation time and any residue left in
the nebulizer compartment were measured.

Pain Test
A standardized 2-min ice water test (ice cold
immersion test) was used as model for acute
pain.17–19 The right hand was immersed in ice-
saturated water (1.6  0.048C) and if pain was
considered
as
intolerable
before
2
min
had
elapsed, the subject could withdraw the hand.
Perceived pain intensity was rated continuously
with an electronically controlled VAS system and
recorded on a computer. Peak pain, area under
the pain intensity-time curve, and mean pain
were determined. If the hand was withdrawn
before the end of 2 min, pain intensity was
considered to be maximal until the end of the
2-min period (for calculation of the area under the
curve).
Monitoring of Side Effects
A VAS was used to asses psychological and
somatic side effects, such as sedation, euphoria,
anxiety, nausea, vertigo, headache, irritation of
airways, etc. The volunteers were instructed to
report how they felt at the moment of answering
the VAS questionnaire. On the 10-cm VAS scale,
0 cm (0%) represented ‘‘not at all,’’ 10 cm (100%)
represented ‘‘very strong.’’ Hemoglobin oxygen
saturation (pulse oximetry), blood pressure, and
heart rate were recorded by using an HP 78352C
patient monitoring system from Hewlett Packard.
Statistical Analysis
The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for
nonparametric data was used for comparison of
the side effects in the pulmonary application ses-
sions. p < 0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant. No
statistical comparison was made with the results
from the iv session because this THC application
was not blinded. Analyses were performed in
STATA, version 8.1 for MacOS X (STATA Corp.,
College Station, TX).
Analysis of Plasma Samples
Plasma concentrations of THC and its metabolites
11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC were determin-
ed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Extraction of the 0.5-mL plasma aliquots was
performed automatically by using an ASPEC XL
(Automatic Sample Preparation with Extraction
Columns) system equipped with a Dilutor 402
(Gilson, Villiers Le Bel, France) and applying the
method of Moeller et al.20 Hydrolyzation, deriva-
tization, and gas chromatography/mass spectrom-
etry analysis were performed according to the
method of Feng et al.21 The method was linear in
the following calibrated ranges: from 0.4 to 20 ng/
mL for THC in the lower concentration levels,
from 20 to 300 ng/mL for THC in the higher
concentration levels, and from 0.4 to 100 ng/mL
for the two metabolites 11-OH-THC and 11-
COOH-THC. Samples exceeding the linearity
range
were
diluted
with
blank
plasma,
re-
extracted, and again analyzed. The limit of quanti-
ﬁcation for THC and its metabolites was 0.4 ng/mL
plasma.
Pharmacokinetic Calculations
Plasma concentrations versus time were used to
calculate pharmacokinetic parameters, including
plasma peak concentrations (Cmax), time to reach
peak plasma concentrations (tmax), and area
under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Based
on a noncompartmental model, all pharmacoki-
netic parameters were assessed by use of stan-
dard calculation procedures performed by the
TopFit (version 2.0) computer software.22 AUC
from time 0 to inﬁnity (AUC0–1) or the time
corresponding to the last measurable concentra-
tion (AUC0–x) was calculated by numeric integra-
tion using the linear trapezoidal rule. Values for
C0 (extrapolated) were determined by linear
regression of the logarithmically transformed
concentration values back to the time point 0.
RESULTS
The results of the quality assurance of the test
medications, which allowed their clinical use, are
listed in Table 1. Figures 1 and 2 show the plasma
proﬁles of THC and the two metabolites 11-OH-
THC and 11-COOH-THC after pulmonal and iv
administration, respectively. None of the baseline
samples showed measurable concentrations of
THC or THC metabolites. The mean plasma level
of pulmonal THC after 10 min was 18.7  7.4 ng/
mL (mean  SEM) with a mean duration of the
inhalation procedure of 23  3 min. The peak
plasma levels of 18.9  5.0 ng/mL were measured
at 20 min (Fig. 1). Then, the plasma concentra-
tions decreased rapidly. Peak plasma levels of the
two main metabolites 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-
THC were 1.4  0.3 ng/mL occurring at 40 min
and 10.0  2.9 ng/mL at 120 min, respectively.
The plasma levels 5 min after the iv injection of

1179
JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 93, NO. 5, MAY 2004

THC (0.053 mg/kg body weight) ranged from 81.6
to 640.6 ng/mL (271.5  61.1 ng/mL; Fig. 2). After
that, the plasma levels decreased rapidly. Peak
plasma levels of 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC
were 9.1  0.8 ng/mL occurring at 5 or 10 and
36.7  3.8 ng/mL occurring at 60 min, respec-
tively. The ratio of the AUC0–480 of THC to the
AUC0–480 of its psychoactive metabolite 11-OH-
THC was 4.4 to 1 and 6.6 to 1 after pulmonal
and iv THC, respectively. Tables 2 and 3 sum-
marize the pharmacokinetic parameters for pul-
monal and iv THC. The approximate half-lives
for iv and pulmonal THC were 73 and 46 min,
respectively.
The observed psychological and somatic side
effects are depicted in Table 4 and Figure 3. After
pulmonal THC, the symptoms irritation of the
throat and upper respiratory tract, and coughing
were highly signiﬁcant compared with placebo.
These side effects were reversible within 30 min of
ﬁnishing inhalation. In contrast to iv THC, the
psychotropic effects after pulmonal THC were
usually very mild. A signiﬁcant difference versus
pulmonal placebo was observed for pulmonal THC
concerning euphoria, confusion and disorienta-
tion, and change of inner perception. Blood
pressure was not changed by THC, whereas both
pulmonal and iv THC increased heart rate sig-
niﬁcantly as compared with placebo (data not
shown).
As after oral THC,10 pulmonal THC produced
hyperalgesia in the ice water pain test, an effect
which was signiﬁcant versus pulmonal placebo
only after 20 min (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
It was possible to develop an aqueous inhalation
solution of the very hydrophobic THC. The output
rate of the nebulizer device was sufﬁcient to
deliver the required dose of THC within an in-
halation time of 20–25 min. The resulting droplet
size should allow the aerosolized THC to reach
the lower compartments of the lung, thus enabl-
ing a high absorption rate. The quality assurance
of the pulmonal and iv formulation showed good
stability and physiological compatibility. The pul-
monal application of nebulized THC, therefore,
seems to be a promising mode for the clinical use of
THC.
The
pulmonal
bioavailability
of
28.5  23.1% (0.4–60.6%) was higher than after
oral administration, where the bioavailability was
found to be 5–20%.11–13 Some volunteers even

showed a bioavailability of >40%. A study com-
paring the bioavailability of oral and pulmonal
THC in individual volunteers would lead to more
conclusive results. Most of the subjects reached
plasma levels comparable to those of iv THC at
10 and 20 min. Peak plasma levels of THC
were observed before the end of the inhalation
procedure.
Regarding the plasma concentrations of the
THC metabolites 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-
THC, similar patterns for pulmonal and iv THC
were observed. The THC to 11-OH-THC-ratios
found in the present study for iv THC, and in an
earlier study10 for oral THC, conﬁrm the ﬁndings
reported by Wall et al.13 for iv THC. The signiﬁ-
cantly lower formation of the psychoactive 11-OH-
THC after pulmonal THC, due to the absence of
ﬁrst-pass metabolism, results in remarkably less
intensive psychotropic side effects compared with
oral THC. This is an important fact regarding the
development of future THC application forms.
The plasma concentration-time plot of the iv
administration showed ﬁrst a distribution phase
with a very rapid decrease of the THC plasma
levels followed by the elimination phase with a
much longer terminal plasma elimination half-
life. This pattern is compatible with two-compart-
ment elimination kinetics described previously by
Wall et al.13 and Huestis.11
The placebo aerosol was very well tolerated
indicating a good tolerability of the vehicle with
the adjuvants used for solubilization and stabiliza-
tion of the formulation. Nevertheless, irritation of
the airways and coughing after pulmonal THC was
observed for all subjects, meaning that THC itself
caused these adverse effects (p ¼ 0.01). Coughing

impaired the inhalation procedure, and therefore,
most likely also the interindividually most vari-
able bioavailability, which would probably be
higher with a less irritating formulation of THC.
The irritations were reversible within a short time
after the end of inhalation indicating no lasting
damage to the mucosa. This particular effect of
THC was also demonstrated by Tashkin et al.23
Because the micellar formulation used in this
study did not prevent mucosal irritation, other
techniques should be tested, for example the use of
liposomes or microencapsulation. A higher mean
Cmax and very rapid increase in concentration in
the central nervous system were responsible for
the more pronounced adverse effects of iv THC,
which were mainly of a psychotropic nature. THC
did not reduce pain in the ice water test after
pulmonal administration. This conﬁrms the ice
water test results obtained in our previous study
with oral THC. As postulated before,10 this in-
dicates that the low oral bioavailability of THC
is not responsible for the lack of analgesia. It is
assumed that the ice water test is not the right
model to determine an analgesic effect of THC.
In conclusion, the pulmonal administration of a
liquid THC aerosol leads to rapid and high plasma
levels of THC, with a metabolic pattern similar to
that of iv THC. Although the bioavailability was
much higher than after oral THC, no signiﬁcant
analgesic effect was measured with an acute pain
test. Because appropriate experimental chronic
pain models are currently not available, the
analgesic effect of pulmonal THC should be further
tested in pain patients. In addition, other solubi-
lization techniques should be evaluated to improve
the physiological tolerability of pulmonal THC
aerosols.
