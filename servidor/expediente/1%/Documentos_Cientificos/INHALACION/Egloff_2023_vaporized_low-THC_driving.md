Impairment can arise due to tiredness, influence of alcohol, medication, narcotics, amongst other reasons [ 10 11 17 18 18 19 20 Few studies on THC levels after the consumption of low THC/CBD-rich cannabis products are available. Additionally, the manner of administration in most studies involving inhalative consumption has been smoking [ 21 25 26 27 21 22 23 28 24 Concerning the effects of low THC/CBD-rich cannabis products on driving performance, two reports focusing on the oral administration of comparable amounts of THC and CBD in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis found no significant effect [ 29 30 31 32 28 21 23 24 25 This study aimed to investigate THC and CBD levels in blood and whether there is evidence of impaired driving ability after consumption of CBD-rich cannabis with a THC-content < 1%. In study arm 1 (S1) volunteers underwent single consumption of two different cannabis products in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design. Study arm 2 (S2) investigated frequent consumption (twice daily for 10 days) of the two cannabis-products in a randomized, double-blind, parallel design. Interventional products were administered using the Volcano medic® vaporizer, whereby product 1 released 38 mg CBD and 1.8 mg THC, and product 2 39 mg CBD and 0.6 mg THC. As THC-induced impairment is known to occur within initial hours after inhalation [ 11 13 17 33 Methods The study was approved on 29.05.2019 by the ethics committee northwest/central Switzerland (BASEC-ID 2019–00639) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ethical standards between September 2019 and August 2020 at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Basel. This trial was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00018836) on 25.10.2019 and with the Coordination Office for Human Research (kofam) which is operated by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) (SNCTP000003294). Healthy volunteers were recruited via advertisement, webpage and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria were: aged 18 to 65 years; possession of a valid driver’s license; experience of smoking (tobacco and/or cannabis). Exclusion criteria were: insufficient German knowledge; psychiatric or physical disease (including addictive disorders); regular medication; pregnancy, breastfeeding or planned pregnancy; consumption of cannabis-products more than once weekly; non-compliance regarding alcohol abstention, controlled substances, cannabis products (including CBD-cannabis other than study intervention) for two weeks prior to and until the end of study participation and regarding abstaining from driving on study days. All volunteers meeting the inclusion criteria and without any obvious exclusion criteria underwent an interview for assessment of psychiatric disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 34 35 Study intervention Interventional products were prepared according to a computer generated randomization list by unblinded staff not further involved in the trial. The products were administered using the Volcano medic ® Harley Quinn V1 Haze 36 Study design, procedures and experimental sessions The prospective, double-blind, randomized CBDrive study was conducted from September 2019 to August 2020 at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Basel. Study personnel and investigators conducting test days, analysing blood samples and test results, and participants were blinded to the randomization list. The study included two study arms. The placebo-controlled, cross-over study arm 1 (S1) consisted of three experimental sessions scheduled at least seven days apart to prevent carry-over effects. Before each experimental session, participants were tested for drug abuse using the Multi 12AC Dip Test in urine (nal von minden Drug-Screen, Germany). Participants tested positive for any substance were excluded from the study. In female participants, a pregnancy test (Alere hCG Cassette 25 mlU/mL, Abbott, Chicago, USA) was conducted at the first visit. An intravenous line was set up to collect baseline and all subsequent blood samples using 4 mL BD Vacutainer (1.5 mg/mL NaF and 3.0 mg/mL Na 2 Blood analyses Analytical reference CBD and THC substances, and their deuterated analogues (CBD-D3 and THC-D3), were purchased from Lipomed (Arlesheim, Switzerland). Deuterated internal standard (final concentration 3 ng/mL) was added to 0.25 mL whole blood. Sample preparation was performed by automated on-line solid-phase extraction and derivatization with N N 37 Overall driving-related ability Driving-related ability was assessed using the standardised and validated Vienna test system neuropsychological test set DRIVESTA 38 39 40 41 42 44 Outcomes and statistical analyses Prespecified primary outcomes were the THC-concentration in whole blood samples collected at different time points after vaporization of CBD-cannabis and overall driving-related ability, as assessed in a computerised test set.

Some samples were missing due to unfeasibility of blood withdrawals, particularly after repeated use of the venous catheter.
