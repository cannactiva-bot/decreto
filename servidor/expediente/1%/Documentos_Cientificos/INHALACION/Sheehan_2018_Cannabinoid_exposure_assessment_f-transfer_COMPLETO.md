ABSTRACT
Studies have compared the chemical properties of tobacco smoke to those of cannabis smoke,
with the objective of identifying the chemical attributes responsible for the mutagenicity and
carcinogenicity of cannabis smoke. Comparative studies have included small sample sizes and
produced conﬂicting results. The aim of this study was to assess the major chemical and
physical variations of cannabis smoke across a range of cannabis samples of different potencies
and origins, sourced from the illegal market in New Zealand. Twelve cannabis samples were
studied ranging from 1.0% to 13.4% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9THC) content. A smoking
machine was used to smoke “joints” (cannabis cigarettes) and the chemical/physical properties
of the smoke assessed. The chemical constituents of the smoke extracts were analysed by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry. A range of different chemical constituents (in addition to
D9THC) were identiﬁed and their concentrations estimated. Terpenoids were identiﬁed as the
major variable in cannabis smoke, showing a 40-fold range in total terpenoid content. Analysis
of the total particulate matter showed that signiﬁcantly different levels of particulate matter
were produced between the different cannabis samples, ranging from 14.6 to 66.3 mg/g of
cannabis smoked. The D9THC delivery efﬁciency during smoking was also investigated and
produced consistent results showing a mean and median of 12.6% and 10.8%, respectively, of
the theoretically available D9THC (ranging from 7.2% to 28.0%).

Introduction
Cannabis sativa L. (herein referred to as “cannabis”) is a
plant that has a long international history of therapeutic
and recreational application [1]. One major concern of
cannabis use as a medicine is that the most common
route of administration is inhalation via smoking. Litera-
ture available on the smoke chemistry of tobacco, leaves
little doubt that smoking any plant material produces a
range of compounds that have toxic effects on the
human body, in particular, carcinogens [2]. Negative
health consequences of smoke carcinogens raise ques-
tions about smoking cannabis for medicinal purposes.
Like tobacco, the smoking of cannabis has been asso-
ciated with a diverse range of cancers [3,4]. Work con-
ducted in North Africa found an association between
lung cancer and cannabis smoking [5–7], whereas USA
case-control [8] and retrospective cohort [9] studies
failed to ﬁnd an association between cannabis smoke
and lung cancer. These studies may have been inﬂu-
enced by confounding variables such as the combining
of cannabis and tobacco in cannabis joints, or the
fact that cannabis smokers are often also tobacco
smokers [10]. Furthermore, a large pooled analysis of
published and unpublished data found little evidence to
suggest an increased risk in lung cancer [11]. A case-
control study undertaken in New Zealand (NZ), where
the use of tobacco/cannabis mixtures is less common,
showed an 8% increase in the risk of lung cancer for a
cannabis smoker per joint year (one “joint year” being
the equivalent of one joint per day for one year) [10].
Research has focused on the effects that smoking can-
nabis has on the function of human lungs, as it is reason-
able to assume that they will be similar to that of tobacco
smoke, which is known to lead to conditions such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [12]. It has been
suggested that the effects of one joint are equivalent to
that of 2.5–5 tobacco cigarettes in terms of airﬂow
obstruction and hyperinﬂation, due to the way cannabis
is smoked, i.e. without a ﬁlter, with a shorter butt length,
and with deeper/longer inhalation [13].
A review of molecular biological techniques to
assess the toxicity of cannabis smoke showed contra-
dictory results. These studies also used a limited variety
of cannabis samples [14–16]. Maertens et al. [16] noted
that although their results suggested a higher level of
toxicity in cannabis smoke than tobacco smoke, it
would be necessary to experiment across a variety of
cannabis samples.

To date, studies have investigated the composition
and properties of cannabis smoke [17–21], and have
compared it to cigarette smoke [22–27]. Studies have
also examined the composition and properties of can-
nabis smoke produced by different methods of smok-
ing [28–34]. Most studies have been limited to the
comparison of one or two cannabis materials and
tobacco products. When two or more cannabis varie-
ties have been compared, only limited quantitative and
qualitative differences have been demonstrated [35].
The results are also contradictory. For example, some
studies have reported benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) at greater
levels in cannabis smoke than tobacco smoke [22],
whilst others report cannabis smoke to have less
B[a]P [27]. A reason for disagreement between the
studies of cannabis smoke may be the source or variety
of the cannabis being tested, just as different tobacco
products show different smoke properties [36]. Canna-
bis smoke studies have provided substantial information
on the constituents of cannabis smoke, however it is dif-
ﬁcult to draw any conclusions regarding the variability
from different sources of cannabis.
Most research investigating cannabis smoke has
used a single source of cannabis [23,27], and in studies
where more than one cannabis sample was used, the
sample size and range were limited with respect to rela-
tive potency (e.g. two cannabis samples with potencies
of
1.3%
and
4.5%
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(D9THC) [25], or 1.3% and 4.4% D9THC [26]). Other
than the single study by Fischedick et al. [33], using
medicinal cannabis from a single source (6.2%, 10.3%
and 21.7% D9THC), the highest plant D9THC content
previously tested was 4.5% [25] and the lowest was
0.3% [35]. A study by Sparacino et al. [26] states that,
despite knowledge of higher D9THC levels, the canna-
bis sample potencies tested were a practical representa-
tion of the market.
With contradicting conclusions and results on
the
use,
toxicity
and
constituents
of
cannabis
smoke, we chose to investigate the composition of
cannabis smoke from a larger sample set and
greater variety of cannabis samples. It may be that
some strains, potencies or growing conditions of
cannabis contribute variability to smoke constitu-
ents, and the delivery of active constituents to the
smoker. The primary aim of this study was to com-
pare the differences in cannabis smoke composition
when a range of cannabis samples were analysed in
the same laboratory, under the same conditions,
using the same techniques. The present study ﬁlls
in the gaps of the analysis of cannabis smoke from
a broader range of cannabis potencies and cannabis
samples available in NZ, from the illicit street mar-
ket from different sources and growing conditions,
as opposed to cannabis grown under strict pharma-
ceutical
conditions
or
smoked
under
different
conditions.
Materials and methods
Smoking machine
A smoking machine was used, which was made in-
house with parts adapted from a TE-2 smoking
machine, purchased from Teague enterprises (Wood-
land, USA), and parts purchased from Cerulean (Mil-
ton Keynes, UK) to meet as many criteria as possible
of the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) standard for routine analytical cigarette-smoking
machines
[37].
Smoking
experiments,
performed
under the ISO conditions of 35 mL puffs with a dura-
tion of 2 s at intervals of 60 s, used Kentucky reference
cigarettes (3R4F) as controls. We measured the total
particulate matter (TPM) weights and nicotine levels
in the TPM in order to validate the in-house smoking
machine and repeatability of nicotine quantitation
using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) methods described [38]. The repeatability of
nicotine quantitation and the expected amount of
TPM agreed with the expected variability from smok-
ing machines found in international studies [39].
Figure 1 shows the smoking machine used in this
study.
Cannabis samples were ground in a SharpStone
grinder speciﬁcally designed for the task of grinding
cannabis, and purchased from Cosmic Corner in Wel-
lington, NZ. We inserted approximately 650 mg of
each ground cannabis sample into Gizeh Silver tip

King Size Cigarette tubesTM using an Aztec Ezyﬁl Tube
ﬁlling machineTM purchased from Gentlemen’s Corner,
Auckland, NZ. Following preliminary experiments, the
mass of 650 mg of cannabis was chosen as the most
consistent that could be packed into the cigarette tubes
used. To ensure smoking consistency, each joint was
stopped after the puff that would leave the butt length
as close as possible to 20 mm.
Chemicals and standards
Certiﬁed D9THC (1.000 § 0.043) mg/mL and nicotine
(1.000 § 0.006) mg/mL reference standards in MeOH
were purchased from Cerilliant Analytical Reference
Standards (Round Rock, USA). Isopropyl alcohol
(IPA) and MeOH (analytical grade) were purchased
from Thermo Fisher (North Shore City, NZ). The
Cambridge ﬁlter holder (used to collect TPM from the
cigarette smoke) was purchased from Cerulean.
Cannabis plant samples
Cannabis plant samples (a total of 12) acquired from
the Institute of Environmental Science and Research
(ESR), NZ came from police cannabis seizures in the
North Island of NZ. We selected cannabis samples,
using limited information, to reﬂect different areas of
NZ, different growing conditions and different types of
plant material (full sample information cannot be pro-
vided due to legal restrictions).
D9THC Content of cannabis plant samples
The D9THC content of the cannabis plant samples was
measured by air-drying a sub-sample overnight in the
laboratory before accurately weighing 100 mg into
10 mL test tubes [40]. The samples were extracted by
sonication for 15 min in 5 mL of IPA. The solvent was
transferred to a 50 mL volumetric ﬂask via a 0.45 mm
nylon syringe ﬁlter. This extraction was repeated three
times and the extracts added to the same volumetric
ﬂask. The sample tubes were washed three more times
and combined with the previous extracts, and the
50 mL ﬂasks were made up to volume with IPA. Semi-
quantitation of D9THC content by GC/MS used the
parameters listed in Table 1 [41,42]. The D9THC con-
tent of the cannabis plant material is hereafter referred
to as CTHC. Preliminary experiments with D9THC
extraction showed that the procedure produced consis-
tent results for CTHC from the same cannabis sample
(when extracted in triplicate). Given limited sample
sizes, we tested each cannabis sample for CTHC once
from a sub-sample that represented the cannabis
smoked in the smoking experiments.
A semi-quantitation using the D9THC standard
diluted in IPA to concentrations of 50, 100 and
200 mg/mL was performed. Samples were diluted with
IPA when necessary to obtain a result inside the cali-
bration curve.
The cannabis D9THC extract concentration from a
sample requiring a two-fold dilution is used in the fol-
lowing example to demonstrate how we calculated the
CTHC of the plant material:

Joint smoking parameters, extraction and analysis
of TPM
Joints were analysed in batches of ﬁve after pre-condi-
tioning for a minimum of 48 h at 25 C and 60% relative
humidity. Before smoking, we cut the cigarette ﬁlter
from the end to represent smoking without a ﬁlter [10].
During smoking, the TPM of the mainstream smoke
(MSS) of all ﬁve joints was collected on a single pre-
weighed Cambridge ﬁlter holder (containing a ﬁlter).
The holder and joint butts of the joints were re-weighed
to determine the mass of the TPM and the total amount
of cannabis smoked. Because of the inability to stop a
joint being smoked at an exact butt length or after a con-
sistent number of puffs, we recorded the total mass of
cannabis smoked in each session and calculated the

TPM per gram of cannabis smoked to normalize the
amount of TPM. After removing the “TPM” ﬁlter, a sec-
ond ﬁlter was used to wipe any remaining TPM from
the inside [43]. Both ﬁlters were placed in a 50 mL coni-
cal ﬂask and 20 mL of MeOH added, before shaking at
200 rpm for 30 min, ﬁltering using 0.45 mm polyvinyli-
dene diﬂuoride syringe ﬁlters and transferring to 2 mL
amber vials for GC/MS analysis using the conditions
listed in Table 2.
Compounds in the methanolic extraction of the TPM
were identiﬁed by comparison with a Wiley MS library
(7th edition, 80% spectral match). We used a response
factor from an external nicotine standard curve, run at
concentrations of 3.1, 12.5 and 25.0 mg/mL (R2  0.98),
to estimate the concentration of compounds, other than
D9THC, identiﬁed in the smoke extracts [36]. Interpre-
tation of results for compounds other than nicotine and
D9THC should therefore be considered semi-quantita-
tive and for comparative purposes between the samples
of cannabis. Nicotine was not found in the cannabis
samples.
As we found D9THC at high concentrations in all
the TPM extracts, we determined the D9THC concen-
tration using appropriate dilutions. We analysed each
cannabis sample in duplicate and assessed the variabil-
ity using the appropriate statistics [44].
To estimate the concentrations of the different
chemical constituents in the cannabis smoke extracts,
we selected 3 cannabis samples (1.0%, 13.4% and 9.0%
CTHC) from the 12 samples and analysed them in
duplicate to determine identiﬁable compounds. We
integrated peaks in the total ion chromatograms (TICs)
with parameters set to a minimum total ion current
peak height of 200 000. We chose this peak height to
represent approximately ﬁve times the signal-to-noise
ratio. Limitations of the MS library meant that the
identiﬁcation of the cannabinoids eluting close to
D9THC could not be completed, and is therefore
excluded. This method was used as a pragmatic way of
screening, given the number of different compounds/
standards available and the unknown variation.
Delivery efﬁciency of D9THC in cannabis smoke
The D9THC concentrations measured in the TPM
allowed us to calculate the total amount of D9THC
delivered in the joint-smoking process, referred to as
the “delivery efﬁciency”. The delivery efﬁciency is cal-
culated by determining the total amount of D9THC
in the TPM and dividing this by the amount of
D9THC theoretically available in the mass of cannabis
smoked:

Þ

Þ 

  100:
(3)
Measuring the D9THC delivery efﬁciency is important
because previous studies have suggested that most of
the D9THC in the joint does not transfer to the
MSS [32,45], whilst others have reported that over
60% is transferred to the MSS under different combus-
tion conditions [30,46].
TPM Accounted for by D9THC
We also determined the percentage of TPM, for all
duplicate results, accounted for by D9THC, i.e. the per-
centage of the TPM by mass that was D9THC:

Determining
the
percentage
of
TPM
that
is
accounted for by D9THC is important because it
may provide information regarding harm reduction,
i.e. cannabis materials that release higher levels of
D9THC in smoke relative to other particulates. Sim-
ilar studies have investigated this idea using vapor-
izers [29].
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the t-test were
used in this study to determine if the variables mea-
sured were statistically different between cannabis
samples. ANOVA is a statistical method commonly
used to determine if there are signiﬁcant differences
between the sample means of data-sets. To test for
signiﬁcant differences between only two means, the
t-test can be performed. Using either test, results are
generally considered signiﬁcant if the P-value < 0.05
(95% probability) and this was deemed appropriate
for the results in this study [47]. Statistical tests were
performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, version:
14.07194.5000.

Results
Cannabis sample D9THC content
There was a range (1.0%–13.4%) in CTHC in the 12
cannabis samples, as shown in Table 3. One sample,
which consisted mainly of cannabis leaf material (as
opposed to ﬂowering heads), had the third lowest level
of CTHC (1.9%). Whilst we had some information
regarding the geographical location of the cannabis,
our sample numbers prohibit meaningful regional
comparisons.
TPM Collected from joints
The mass of TPM produced from the cannabis samples
ranged from 14.6 to 66.3 mg/g (Table 3). We observed,
using ANOVA of the duplicate results in Table 3, sig-
niﬁcant differences in the levels of TPM per gram of
cannabis smoked between the different cannabis sam-
ples (P < 0.001), although there was no clear relation-
ship to a factor other than the samples being different
sources of cannabis.
D9THC Levels in the cannabis smoke TPM
The percentage of TPM accounted for by D9THC
appears to separate into two groups; four cannabis
samples with CTHC < 5.8% produced one group where
the D9THC accounts for a lower percentage of the
TPM (mean 8.8%), and the higher CTHC samples
(CTHC  5.8%) produced TPM where the D9THC
accounts for a much higher percentage (mean 25.5%)
see Equation (4) . The groups were treated as inde-
pendent means and a two-tailed unpaired t-test was
performed showing a strong signiﬁcant difference
between the two: tstat = ¡9.14, tcrit = 2.11, P < 1 £
10¡7 (see Table 3 for individual sample results).
The delivery efﬁciency of D9THC during smoking is
reasonably consistent across all the cannabis samples
(Table 3). The mean and median delivery efﬁciencies
are 12.6% and 10.8%, respectively (range 7.2–28.0%).
The cannabis sample with CTHC = 5.8% differs from
the other samples, delivering a higher percentage of
the theoretically available D9THC. The 5.8% CTHC
sample is also isolated from the other cannabis samples
in terms of potency, with the nearest potencies being
2.7% and 9.0% CTHC [38]. The numerical results are
listed in Table 3.
Compounds detected in the cannabis smoke TPM
As expected, we found the most abundant groups of
compounds in the cannabis smoke TPM to be canna-
binoids. Figure 2 is an example TIC of a cannabis
smoke TPM extract with labels indicating the areas of
cannabinoids and other classes of identiﬁable com-
pounds. We examined all of the cannabis smoke
extract chromatograms, with three chosen for thor-
ough interpretation (1.0%, 13.4% and 9.0% CTHC) to
cover the range of D9THC potencies observed.
Terpenoids
We investigated all 12 cannabis samples further for ter-
penoid content. The region in the chromatograms
associated with terpenoids showed a general increase
in both number and total concentration of terpenoids
detected with increasing CTHC. ANOVA of the results
showed that the number of measurable terpenoids in
the lowest CTHC sample is signiﬁcantly lower than the
number in samples with higher CTHC (P < 0.001). In
the three lowest CTHC cannabis samples (1.0%, 1.4%
and 1.9% CTHC), only three or fewer terpenoids were
measureable. At higher CTHC levels (12.2% CTHC), we
detected 25 different terpenoids and estimated their
yields. The total mass of terpenoids (mg) per gram of
cannabis smoked can be used as an indicator of the
Table 3. The D9THC content (CTHC), total particulate matter (TPM), delivery efﬁciency and mass of terpenoid data for the cannabis
samples in this study.

total variability of terpenoid content in different can-
nabis samples (Table 3).
The variability observed in the total mass of terpe-
noids per gram of cannabis smoked vs. CTHC may be a
natural variable of the smoking process. The results
strongly indicate a general increase with increasing
CTHC (Figure 3 and Table 3). Variability in the identity
of the different terpenoids from each cannabis TPM
extract can also be seen. Table 4 shows the terpenoids
identiﬁed in all 12 samples. Some terpenoids in Table 4
are listed multiple times due to the lack of readily avail-
able standards, and ambiguity in the identiﬁcation of
terpenoids in cannabis as there are more than 20 000
known terpenoids [48]. However, based on the order
of elution, retention times (RTs) and library matching,
any repeats of minor isomers are distinguishable as dif-
ferent terpenoids.
Discussion
The analysis of a range of cannabis samples has identi-
ﬁed novel properties of cannabis smoke, which may be
linked to the source or type of cannabis material.
The cannabis CTHC levels obtained indicate that the
cannabis samples used cover a realistic range, based on
national and international work [40–42,49–53]. It has
often been noted in international studies that over
time, there has been an increase in the CTHC of canna-
bis. A published NZ study, analysing cannabis from
the illegal market, reported cannabis CTHC levels
between 1976 and 1996 [40], and indicated that at the
time of publication (2000), no cannabis above 10%
CTHC had been tested in NZ. More recent testing in
NZ has shown a maximum of 18.1% CTHC cannabis

No entry in the table means that the terpenoid was not detected; NQ: the terpenoid was detected but its concentration could not be estimated. Any compounds repeated in the table are based on the best matching mass spectrum in the
MS library, however, based on the retention times (RTs) it can be conﬁrmed that they are all different terpenoids. Results are rounded to the nearest 10 mg/g; rep 1 and rep 2 refer to measurements from the same cannabis sample during
different smoking sessions on different days, each time collected from ﬁve joints.

2016). This study contains ﬁve samples that are above
10%, with a maximum of 13.4% CTHC and may indi-
cate an increasing trend in cannabis CTHC levels on the
NZ market. A grow study performed in NZ showed
that cannabis sourced in NZ has the potential to pro-
duce ﬂowering heads containing up to 30% CTHC [54],
although this has yet to be seen.
Our results indicate signiﬁcant differences in the
levels of TPM received by a smoker from different can-
nabis samples. There is some suggestion from our
results of a general increase in TPM with increasing
CTHC; however, exceptions, notably, that the lowest
CTHC material (1.0%) produced a signiﬁcantly higher
level of TPM when compared with the two closest
CTHC samples (1.4% and 1.9%). A possibility for this
observation may be the growing conditions of the can-
nabis samples, or the type of plant material.
The percentage of TPM accounted for by D9THC
correlated to CTHC, shows that the smoker is receiving
more D9THC per unit of TPM when smoking cannabis
material with a higher CTHC. This is expected, as the
higher CTHC accounts for an increased proportion of
TPM in the smoke.
As mentioned above, the D9THC delivery efﬁciencies
are reasonably consistent across all the cannabis sam-
ples, but it is not clear why the 5.8% CTHC cannabis
sample is an outlier (although not statistically so). A
study by Fehr and Kalant [46] reported higher D9THC
delivery efﬁciencies (between 34.2% and 62.2%) how-
ever, they used different ﬂow-rates/pufﬁng conditions
for a single cannabis sample, rather than constant
smoking behaviour for multiple cannabis samples. Fehr
and Kalant also combusted the entire cannabis material
in the joint (including the butt) and thus their results
are not directly comparable with ours. The results
reported here represent, in our view, realistic delivery
efﬁciencies under the smoking conditions used. Estima-
tions that up to 50% of the D9THC is lost in sidestream
smoke, up to 30% is destroyed by pyrolysis and 10%
is
trapped
in
the
butt
of
the
joint
have
been
reported [32,45]. The present study ﬁlls in the gaps of
accessing D9THC recovery from multiple cannabis sam-
ples with a diverse range of potencies. Our results indi-
cate that the percentage of available D9THC delivered
in the MSS remains consistent when the joints are
smoked in a consistent way. When the D9THC delivery
efﬁciencies and percentages of TPM accounted for by
D9THC are considered together, it suggests that the
combustion and composition of cannabis smoke are
not consistent between samples from varying sources.
There have been suggestions that terpenoids play
an important role in the therapeutic effects of canna-
bis [33,55,56]. Some research promotes the concept
that cannabis has other herbal and synergistic compo-
nents, as well as D9THC, and therefore medicinal
products containing only D9THC are potentially less
effective therapeutically [56]. Various terpenoids that
are found in cannabis are known to have pharmacolog-
ical properties themselves. For example, caryophyllene
(detected in this research) is reported to be an agonist
to the CB2 receptor and to provide anti-inﬂammatory
effects [57]. b-Elemene (also detected) has been shown
to have anti-carcinogenic properties [58]. In contrast
to the potential therapeutic applications of terpenoids,
there is also evidence that they are precursors for poly-
aromatic hydrocarbons [59], which raises the question
of toxic side-effects. The results of the terpenoids anal-
ysis in this study show that not only is the total mass
of terpenoids greater in cannabis samples with higher
CTHC levels, but there is a signiﬁcant variability in the
terpenoids in each sample. Previous research showed
similar correlations between terpenoid and cannabi-
noid composition in cannabis plant material [55], and
there are also reports of terpenoids as a major constitu-
ent of cannabis smoke [33]. In contrast, our results
suggest that terpenoids are one of the most variable
constituents of cannabis smoke with potentially a 40-
fold variation between samples. Whilst the study by
Fischedick et al. [33] identiﬁed terpenoids as a major
constituent of cannabis smoke, it was not directed at
the variability of terpenoids, but rather the binding
afﬁnity of smoke extracts to cannabinoid receptors.
Hence, Fischedick et al. [33] may not have identiﬁed
the variability of terpenoids presented here.
The terpenoids identiﬁed in this study are primarily
sesquiterpenoids, but monoterpenoids are also present.
This could be due to the taxonomy of the cannabis
samples grown in NZ or a consequence of cannabis
storage. It has been shown that the composition of ter-
penoids in the production of essential oils not only
depends on the method of production of the oil but
also on growing conditions such as soil, climate,
growth stage, harvest time and previous storage of the
plant material [60].
Conclusion
In conjunction with cannabinoids, we found terpe-
noids to be the most variable component of cannabis
smoke. Our results show that in cannabis smoke, ter-
penoids show a total increase with increasing D9THC
content. The potential for terpenoids to be precursors
for carcinogens highlights the question of smoking
technique, as smoking cannabis joints with higher lev-
els of D9THC may lead to higher levels of carcinogens
such as B[a]P.
There is a general increase in the TPM of cannabis
smoke with increasing cannabis plant D9THC content.
An increased level of TPM may have detrimental effects
on the user, including carcinogenicity and respiratory
irritation, and the D9THC results from this study also
show that when cannabis is smoked under the same
conditions, the D9THC delivery efﬁciency is consistent
across a range of cannabis potencies. In terms of
FORENSIC SCIENCES RESEARCH
175

delivery efﬁciency, we found the cannabis sample with a
potency of 5.8% CTHC to be more efﬁcient than the
other cannabis samples (approximately 25% delivery
efﬁciency). Other than the single outlier, the mean and
median delivery efﬁciencies of D9THC are approxi-
mately 13% and 11%, respectively, and the 5.8% CTHC
sample lies in a potency gap between the other samples.
The results also showed that the percentage of TPM
accounted for by D9THC has a tendency to reach a
maximum at higher potencies. This suggests that once
the cannabis reaches a certain D9THC level, the
smoker receives a consistently higher ratio of D9THC
to TPM, whereas at lower potencies the smoker
receives less D9THC per unit of TPM, and this raises
the question of whether or not there are health beneﬁts
in smoking cannabis with a higher CTHC.
The cannabis samples tested showed a range of 1.0–
13.4% CTHC content. Not only has this range of cannabis
potencies allowed us to uncover trends in the chemistry
of cannabis smoke, but it also validates that the ﬁndings
are relevant to the toxicology of cannabis smoke pro-
duced from a representative sample of the cannabis
available in national and international markets.
