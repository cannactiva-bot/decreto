## Objective (one line)

Help EIHA **win 0.5% in CAP/varieties** while also opening a **politically safe, evidence‑anchored pathway to 1.0%** for **hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86)** (and a separate downstream track for products classified under CN Chapter 24).

## 90‑second pitch (EN)

EIHA’s 0.5% proposal is the right “institutional win”: it restores a historically used EU threshold, improves farmer legal certainty, and fits CAP/CMO logic.

In parallel, we should acknowledge that **hemp flowers and biomass (CN 1211 90 86)** have become a distinct and high‑risk‑of‑fragmentation category in the internal market. A variety‑only threshold does not fully solve the **product‑level legal certainty problem** that operators face across Member States.

We propose adding a narrow, risk‑based Annex that sets a **targeted 1.0% total THC benchmark** for **CBD‑dominant hemp flowers/biomass** (CN 1211 90 86), anchored to a European technical reference: **Ph. Eur. 3028** recognises a CBD‑dominant cannabis flower category with **total THC up to 1.0%** and **total CBD at least 5.0%** (dried material). This is not “more THC”; it is category‑specific legal certainty combined with safeguards.

We can keep all the usual public‑health reassurances: the 1.0% lane stays limited to CBD‑dominant profiles and is coupled with marketing standards (traceability, batch testing, contaminants, labelling). And we keep **CN Chapter 24** (tobacco substitutes / smokeables) as a separate downstream annex so it does not contaminate the CAP negotiation.

Subject: Complementary lane to EIHA 0.5% paper — targeted legal certainty for hemp flowers (CN 1211 90 86)

Hi Francesco,

First, I strongly support EIHA’s proposal to restore a harmonised 0.5% THC threshold at EU level, as it is the most realistic CAP/varieties ask and a strong internal‑market harmonisation message.

In parallel, I would like to suggest a short companion Annex focused on **hemp flowers/biomass (CN 1211 90 86)**. The market has evolved, and operators face fragmentation and legal uncertainty that a variety‑only threshold does not fully resolve.

The Annex would propose a **targeted, risk‑based pathway** to a **1.0% total THC** benchmark for **CBD‑dominant** flowers/biomass, anchored to a European technical reference: **European Pharmacopoeia “Cannabis flower” (Ph. Eur. 3028)** recognises a CBD‑dominant category with **total THC ≤ 1.0%** and **total CBD ≥ 5.0%** (dried material). This provides a credible EU benchmark for a low‑risk CBD‑dominant raw‑material category.

We can frame this as a narrow internal‑market legal certainty tool, coupled with safeguards via optional marketing standards (traceability, batch testing, labelling, contaminants), while keeping the CAP negotiation clean. Any downstream “smokeable / CN Chapter 24” issues can be mentioned only as a separate annex to avoid spillover into the CAP file.

If you agree, I can provide proposed wording in EIHA style (2–3 paragraphs + an Annex) that complements the existing paper without changing the main 0.5% line.

Best regards,

## “Kill‑shot” bullets (EN) — concise arguments that work in Brussels

- **Two‑lane strategy**: 0.5% is the CAP/varieties win; 1.0% is a targeted internal‑market legal certainty lane for CN 1211 90 86.
- **Different regulatory object**: hemp flowers/biomass are not the 1980s fibre/seed market; they require category‑specific rules.
- **EU technical benchmark exists**: Ph. Eur. 3028 recognises CBD‑dominant cannabis flower with total THC up to 1.0% and CBD ≥5% (dried).
- **Risk‑based + safeguards**: keep the 1.0% lane limited to CBD‑dominant profiles + marketing standards (traceability/testing/labelling/contaminants).
- **Enforcement‑friendly**: clear thresholds + batch testing reduces fragmentation and avoids criminal‑law ambiguity.
- **Don’t contaminate CAP**: keep “CN Chapter 24 smokeables/tobacco substitutes” strictly as a downstream annex.

## Answer to the “varieties vs final product” objection (EN)

If someone says: “0.5% is only for varieties, the final product can be higher”:

> That is precisely why we need a targeted product‑category lane for CN 1211 90 86. Variety thresholds solve CAP eligibility and catalogue harmonisation, but they do not fully solve product‑level legal certainty and enforcement fragmentation for hemp flowers/biomass in the internal market.

## Don’t step on rakes (EN) — quick hygiene fixes

- **CN code**: fibre is CN **5302** (“true hemp”), not “5290”.
- **Switzerland**: do not call Switzerland an EEA member (it is not); refer to Switzerland as a European benchmark outside the EU (EFTA/bilateral framework).
- **Avoid fragile “cigarette counts”**: any “how many joints” calculation becomes weaker as the THC % increases; better to use real‑world benchmark + risk‑based safeguards.

## Notas rápidas (ES) — cómo lo vendería yo

- **Concede**: “0,5% = restauración histórica + win CAP”.
- **Gira**: “pero flores/biomasa (CN 1211 90 86) = objeto distinto, mercado distinto, problema distinto”.
- **Ancla**: “Ph. Eur. 3028 ya reconoce CBD‑dominante con THC total máx. 1% y CBD mín. 5%”.
- **Tranquiliza**: “limitado a CBD‑dominante + marketing standards (opt‑in) para enforcement”.
- **Separa**: “Chapter 24 / smokeables = anexo downstream para no contaminar CAP”.
