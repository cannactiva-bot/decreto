ABSTRACT  
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the risks for human 
health related to the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in milk and other food of animal origin.  THC, more 
precisely d elta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is derived from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa . In fresh plant 
material , up to 90  % of total Δ9-THC is present as the non -psychoactive precursor Δ9-THC acid. Since few data on 
∆9-THC levels in foods of animal origin wer e available, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain ( CONTAM 
Panel ) estimated acute human dietary exposure to ∆9-THC combining different scenarios for the presence of 
∆9-THC in hemp seed -derived feed materials . Acute exposure to ∆9-THC from the consump tion of milk and dairy 
products ranged between 0.001 and 0.0 3 µg/kg  body weight  (b.w.) per day in adults, and 0.006 and 0. 13 µg/kg 
b.w. per day  in toddlers . From human data, t he CONTAM Panel concluded that 2.5  mg Δ9-THC /day, 
corresponding to 0.036  mg Δ9-THC/kg  b.w. per day, represents the lowest  observed adverse effect level. By 
applying an overall uncertainty factor of 30, an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 1 μg Δ9-THC/kg  b.w. was derived. 
The exposure estimates are at most 3  % and 13 % the ARfD, in adults and toddlers , respectively.  The CONTAM 
Panel conclude d that exposure to ∆9-THC via consumption of milk and dairy products , resulting from the use of 
hemp seed -derived feed materials  at the reported concentrations , is unlikely to pose a health concern. A risk 
assessment resulting from the use of whole hemp plant -derived feed materials is currently not feasible  due to a 
lack of occurrence data. The CONTAM Panel could also  not conclude on the possible risks to public health from 
exposure to ∆9-THC via consumpt ion of animal tissues and eggs , due to a lack of data on the potential transfer and 
fate of ∆9-THC .

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 2 SUMMARY  
Following a request from the European Commission (EC), the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the 
Food Chain ( CONTAM  Panel) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion for human health related to 
the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in milk and other food of animal origin. 
Tetrahydrocannabinol, more precisely delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is the most relevant 
constituent derived from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa . Four stereoisomers of Δ9-THC are possible, 
with ( -)-trans -Δ9-THC being the only naturally occurring isomer. Delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, 
whic h is found in the growing and harvested plant, is the biosynthetic precursor of Δ9-THC. Beside s 
2-COOH -Δ9-THC , which in this opinion is referred to as Δ9-THCA -A, another positional isomer, 
4-COOH -Δ9-THC, denoted  as Δ9-THCA -B, may also occur in the hemp pla nt. In fresh plant material 
of C. sativa , up to 90 % of the ‘total’ Δ9-THC is present as the non -psychoactive precursor 
Δ9-THCA -A. The rate and extent of transformation of the precursor acids into Δ9-THC in the plant 
material is dependent on physical effec ts, in particular temperature . In addition to Δ9-THC, C. sativa  
preparations may contain at least 60 other cannabinoids, several of which are biologically active.  This 
risk assessment does not evaluate the exposure and associated risks of cannabis used as a medicinal 
drug or for recreational purposes, but as requested in the terms of reference (ToR) addresses  the 
potential risks caused through human dietary exposure from food of animal origin. Cannabinoids other 
than Δ9-THC are also beyond the ToR and are n ot considered in the opinion, unless there is potential 
for interaction with Δ9-THC. Therefore, this assessment concentrates on the primary psychoactive 
cannabinoid Δ9-THC, in particular ( -)-trans -Δ9-THC . 
In the European Union (EU), the cultivation of C. sativa varieties is granted provided they are listed in 
the EU’s ‘ Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species ’ and the THC content does 
not exceed 0.2 %. The hemp plant is a multi-purpose crop grown both for its fibres – principally for 
industrial purposes - and seed for the production of feeding stuffs. For example, hemp seed cake (the 
residue of the seed after oil extraction) may be used to replace – or be fed in conjunction with – 
oilseed meals, such as rape seed meal, in diets for cows, pigs and horses. A less common practice is 
the use of leaves, flowers and stalks (the by-product of hemp production for fibres and seeds) as feed 
for ruminants and pigs.  
The determination of Δ9-THC in hemp plants used/grown for feed is prescribed by Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009. The official method based on capillary gas chromatography with 
flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) is not able to differentiate between the psychoactive Δ9-THC and 
its non-psychoactive precursor acids. Capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) following liquid-liquid extraction or solid phase microextraction is the method of choice for 
the determination of Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids in hemp-containing food products. A separate 
determination of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids is possible by derivatization, such as silylation of the 
extract prior to gas chromatography ( GC) analysis or by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS). 
As high temperatures are not generated during de-hulling and oil extraction, these processes are not 
expected to result in increased levels of ∆9-THC in the oil or meal resulting from decarboxylation of 
precursor acids. Although most milk is subjected to pasteurisation prior to marketing and 
consumption, the temperatures used are unlikely to result in decarboxylation of any non-psychoactive 
precursors that may be present as a result of transfer from feed.  
Following a call for data, by the end of June 2014 a total of 603 analytical results on cannabinoids 
from eight different countries were available in the EFSA database, 281 on food and 322 on feed. 
Only very few samples of animal origin were reported, i.e. two samples of cheese, and two samples 
reported as meat products. The CONTAM Panel decided not to use the 603 available analytical results 
on cannabinoids to estimate dietary exposure to Δ9-THC. This decision was based on the fact that in 
many cases the data represented the sum of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids since they were analysed 
by GC- MS or by GC-FID each  without prior derivatization , and in other cases the presence of Δ9-THC 
was not confirmed.

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 3 Individual data on levels of THC in hemp plants used in the EFSA FEEDAP Scientific Opinion (2011) 
were also available, together with some aggregated data on THC in hemp plants collected between 
2009-2012 and provided by the EC. As the data did not differentiate between Δ9-THC and its 
precursor acids, they were not considered suitable for the exposure assessment. 
A
t a later stage, additional analytical data on levels of different cannabinoids in food and feed, were 
provided by the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) and the Swiss Federal Food Safety and 
Veterinary Office (FSVO). These data included clearly defined levels of Δ9-THC on hemp seed-
derived feed materials and were considered in the different scenarios used to carry out dietary 
exposure assessment. 
Acute dietary exposure to ∆9-THC was estimated combining different scenarios for the presence of 
∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed materials, the transfer rate from feed to milk, the daily milk yield 
(L/cow), the daily feed consumption and the human consumption of milk and dairy products.  
In adults, acute exposure to ∆9-THC through the consumption of milk and dairy products ranged 
between 0.001 µg/kg body weight (b.w.) per day and 0.03 µg/kg b.w. per day, the latter obtained 
under the scenario 20  litres (L) milk yield and 11 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed 
materials. In toddlers, acute exposure estimations to ∆9-THC through the consumption of milk and 
dairy products ranged between 0.006 µg/kg b.w. per day and 0.13 µg/kg b.w. per day, the latter 
obtained under the scenario 20 L milk yield and 11 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed 
materials.  
Due to the lack of ∆9-THC data on whole hemp plant-derived feed materials a dietary exposure 
assessment, assuming a potential transfer of ∆9-THC from feed to milk, was not possible.  
As pregnant women are not considered different from other population groups with respect to 
consumption of dairy products, the CONTAM Panel concluded that a separate exposure scenario was 
not needed.  
There is substantial uncertainty associated with the exposure estimates obtained under the different 
scenarios. This uncertainty is mainly due to the limited number of available analytical data on 
∆9-THC, and the lack of information on the fate of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids in the rumen of the 
cow and during food processing.  
Dietary exposure to ∆9-THC via consumption of animal tissues and eggs could not be estimated, due 
to a lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC.  
After oral exposure, Δ9-THC is slowly and incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The 
oral bioavailability is lower compared to inhalation. In humans following oral administration of 
Δ9-THC, levels in plasma of the inactive metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC are higher and 
measurable for longer compared to the parent compound and the active metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC. 
Thus, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC is a good indicator of the oral exposure to Δ9-THC irrespective of the 
source of Δ9-THC. Δ9-THC is highly bound to plasma proteins (97 –99 %) and exhibits extensive 
tissue distribution, rapidly entering highly vascularised tissues resulting in a quick decrease in plasma 
concentration. Due to its lipophilic nature, Δ9-THC is accumulated in adipose tissue and may be 
released back to other tissues including the brain. Studies in both rats and humans indicate that the in 
vivo conversion of ∆9-THCA- A to Δ9-THC does not occur. The main oxidative biotransformation 
pathways occur in the liver. Extrahepatic biotransformations resulting in hydroxylation of the pentyl 
side chain have been documented in brain microsomes from mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. The 
main metabolic pathways are cytochrome P450 ( CYP )-mediated with generation of the psychoactive 
11-OH-Δ9-THC, a further oxidation to the inactive carboxylic acid 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC and the 
glucuronidation of the parent compound and both metabolites. CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes are 
primarily involved in Δ9-THC metabolism in humans. Polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 enzyme have 
been shown to alter the kinetics of Δ9-THC. Oral administration of Δ9-THC results in a higher extent

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 4 of metabolism of Δ9-THC to the psychoactive metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC compared to exposure from 
smoking. Δ9-THC and its metabolites are slowly excreted via the faeces mainly, and also in urine; an 
active entero- hepatic cycle has been described. Milk excretion of Δ9-THC has been documented in 
humans and in a number of laboratory animals.  
No data were identified on the fate of Δ9-THCA-A in farm animals, in particular whether or not it is 
converted to Δ9-THC. The milk excretion of Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC 
has been documented in ruminants. Tissue distribution in intravenous (i.v.) dosed pigs reflects that 
described in experimental animals. 
In dairy cows, limited data indicate that the transfer rate of Δ9-THC to milk is in the range of 0.10 –
0.15 %.  No appropriate studies could be identified to derive a transfer rate into other animal products. 
The major effects of Δ9-THC are mediated by the cannabinoid receptor system. The presence of 
specific polymorphisms of genes in the endocannabinoid system (CNR1, FAAH and COMT 
Val158Met) may affect the response to Δ9-THC. 
In experimental animal studies, acute exposure to doses up to 3 000 and 9 000 mg Δ9-THC/kg in dogs 
and monkeys, respectively, were not lethal. The oral LD 50 for rats and mice were 666 mg Δ9-THC/kg 
and 482 mg Δ9-THC/kg, respectively. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, findings included 
mortality attributable to treatment at the high dose (500 mg/kg b.w. per day), decreases in body 
weight, nervous system effects, decreases in epididymal weights and sperm motility and increases in 
abnormal sperm, lower uterus weight, increase in oestrus cycle length. Histopathological findings 
included atrophy of the testes and ovarian and uterine hypoplasia. In repeated dose toxicity studies in 
mice, decreases in body weight, nervous system effects, lower sperm concentration, increase in oestrus 
cycle length, lower uterus weight, hyperplasia of thyroid gland follicular cells and of the forestomach 
were noted. Δ9-THC exposure affects various components of the immune system in mice, i.e. natural 
killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells. Resistance to influenza virus was shown to be affected. 
Perinatal exposure of mice to Δ9-THC caused fetal thymic atrophy and T cell dysfunction, postnatally. 
There is no evidence of teratogenicity following exposure to Δ9-THC in rodent studies. Other findings 
from reproduction studies in rats and mice include decreases in the number of viable pups, an increase 
in fetal mortality and early resorptions, in the presence of maternal toxicity. Δ9-THC and other 
cannabinoids may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis mainly via the interaction with 
cannabinoid receptor CB 1 found in the hypothalamus, mainly resulting in a depression of the 
reproductive hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone. The major neurotoxic effects of Δ9-THC in 
experimental animals include alterations in locomotor activity, reduced social interactions and 
impaired learning. These behavioural alterations have been observed following acute or chronic 
administration of Δ9-THC, and in adult animals that were exposed to Δ9-THC during development. 
The developing brain appears to be sensiti ve to Δ9-THC at doses that have no adverse effects in the 
adult brain (1 mg/kg b.w.). Although Δ9-THC has shown some limited DNA damage in vitro , the 
available evidence indicates that it is not genotoxic in vivo . There was equivocal evidence of 
carcinogeni c activity of ∆9-THC in male and female mice based on increased incidences of thyroid 
gland follicular cell adenomas at 125 mg/kg b.w. per day. 
From human data, observed central nervous system (CNS) effects, as well as the increase in heart rate 
are considerable at low Δ9-THC levels and are both relevant for the risk assessment. Since these 
effects occur within a short time after administration, the CONTAM Panel concluded that it was 
appropriate to establish an acute reference dose (ARfD) for Δ9-THC. From the reported human data, 
the CONTAM Panel further concluded that adverse effects on the human CNS , such as mood 
alteration and sedation, are the most sensitive endpoint and thus, these dose-response relationships are 
most suitable for the derivation of the ARfD for Δ9-THC. The CONTAM Panel concluded that for the 
purpose of this risk assessment 2.5 mg  Δ9-THC/day, corresponding to 
0.036 mg  Δ9-THC/kg b.w. per day for a person with a body weight of 70 kg, may be regarded as the 
lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) in both single and repeated uses. By applying an 
overall uncertainty factor (UF) of 30 (using an UF of 3 for extrapolation from the LOAEL to a no-

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 5 observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and a UF of 10 for interindividual differences) an ARfD of 
1 μg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. was established by the CONTAM Panel. From repeated dose toxicity data in 
rodents, the CONTAM Panel identified a lowest 10 % lower confidence limit of the benchmark dose 
(BMDL 10) of 0.73 mg Δ9- THC/kg b.w. per day for the increased length in oestrus cycle as a possible 
chronic reference point (RP) for the establishment of a tolerable daily intake (TDI). The CONTAM 
Panel noted that a difference of approximately 700 times is present between the chronic RP calculated 
from experimental animal studies and the established ARfD of 1 μg  Δ9-THC/kg b.w. Therefore, the 
CONTAM Panel concluded that ensuring exposure is below the ARfD would also protect against 
possible effects of repeated exposure and establishing a TDI was not necessary.  
Due to the limited data on ∆9-THC in samples of animal origin, the characterisation of the acute risks 
for human health is based on the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC by means of different 
scenarios, which consider the consumption of milk and dairy products resulting from the use of hemp 
seed-derived feed materials at the reported Δ9-THC concentrations These exposure estimates are at 
most 3 % and 13 % of the ARfD of 1 µg/kg b.w. in adults and toddlers, respectively. The CONTAM 
Panel concluded that the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC, by means of different scenarios that 
consider the consumption of milk and dairy products resulting from the use of hemp seed-derived feed 
materials at the reported concentrations, are unlikely to pose a health concern.  
Due to the lack of representative occurren ce data for Δ9-THC in whole hemp plant-derived feed 
materials, the CONTAM Panel considered a risk assessment of dietary exposure to Δ9-THC via milk 
and dairy products resulting from the use of these feed materials currently not feasible. Therefore, the 
CON TAM Panel could not conclude on the possible risks to public health from the use of whole hemp 
plant-derived feed materials for livestock.  
Due to the lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC in animal tissues and eggs, 
scenarios considering the exposure via other food of animal origin resulting from the use of hemp-
derived feed materials could not be performed. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel did not conclude on 
the possible risks to public health from the consumption of these food commodities. 
The main sources of uncertainty are associated with the dietary exposure estimates obtained under the 
different scenarios (as described previously). Other sources of uncertainty are that information is 
limited or lacking on the fate of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids in food producing animals, and on the 
impact of food processing. There are limited or insufficient data on co- occurrence of Δ9-THC with 
other cannabinoids and possible interactions of cannabinoids. The LOAEL was derived from human 
studies using pure Δ9-THC. 
T
he CONTAM Panel recommended that analytical methods for the analysis of hemp plants and hemp 
derived products should be implemented to differentiate between the psychoactive compound Δ9-THC 
and their non-psychoactive precursor acids. Data on occurrence of Δ9-THC, its precursors and other 
cannabinoids in hemp-derived feed materials for food-producing livestock are needed. Further studies 
on the transfer rate of Δ9-THC, its metabolites, as well as other cannabinoids, and in particular on 
those that are known to be psychoactive, in to animal products intended for human consumption are 
needed. More information is also needed on the fate of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids in food-
producing animals, especially ruminants, and in food processing. Data on occurrence of cannabinoids 
in food, in particular on those that are known to be psychoactive, and those that have the potential to 
interact with Δ9-THC are needed.

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 8 BACKGROUND AS PROVIDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION  
The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) adopted a 
scientific opinion on the safety of hemp ( Cannabis  genus) for use in animal feed on 3 February 2011.4 
In several of the different human exposure scenarios considered, the estimated exposure was higher 
than the established PMTDI of 0.4 µg/kg b.w.  
Therefore it is appropriate to consider the need to establish possible maximum levels for 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in milk and other food of animal origin in the frame of Council 
Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for 
contaminants in food.5 For that purpose a detailed risk assessment as regards the risks for human 
health in relation to the presence of THC in milk and other food of animal origin is needed and 
provides the justification for this request. 
TERMS OF REFERENCE AS PROVIDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION  
In accordance with Art. 29 (1) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 the Commission asks EFSA for a 
scientific opinion on the risks for human health related to the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 
in milk and other food of animal origin.  
The scientific opinion should, inter alia, comprise the: 
a)  evaluation of the toxicity of THC for humans, considering all relevant adverse acute and 
chronic health effects; 
b) estimation of the dietary exposure (chronic and acute dietary exposure) of the EU 
population to THC from milk and other food of animal origin, including the consumption 
patterns of specific (vulnerable) groups of the population (i.e. high consumers, (young) 
children, pregnant women);  
c) assessment of the acute and chronic human health risks as the consequence of the presence 
of THC in milk and other food of animal origin, with particular attention to specific 
(vulnerable) groups of the population (i.e. high consumers, (young) children, pregnant 
women).

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 9 ASSESSMENT  
1. Introduction 
1.1. Interpretation of terms of reference 
On request of the European Commission (EC), the present scientific opinion addresses the ‘risks for 
human health related to the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal origin ’. 
This risk assessment does not evaluate the exposure and associated risks of cannabis used as a 
medicinal drug or for recreational purposes, but as requested in the terms of reference (ToR), 
addresses the potential risks caused through human dietary exposure from food of animal origin. 
Cannabinoids other than tetrahydrocannabinol are also beyond the ToR and are not considered in this 
opinion, unless there is potential for interaction with tetrahydrocannabinol.  
1.2. Background 
The term ‘cannabis’  is often used to denote the several psychoactive preparations of the plant 
Cannabis sativa . While the term ‘cannabis’  refers to the dried flower tops of the female plant of 
C. sativa , it may also be used to describe any part of any plant of the genus Cannabis . A mixture of the 
dried leaves and flowering tops of the female plant of C. sativa  is commonly known as marijuana. The 
unpollinated female plants are referred to as sinsemilla. The resin from the flowering tops of cannabis 
plants is called hashish (WHO, 1997) . Cannabis oil (hashish oil) is a concentrate of cannabinoids 
obtained by solvent extraction of the crude plant material or of the resin. These various preparations of 
C. sativa  contain at least 60 cannabinoids, several of which are biologically active. The cannabinoid 
composition is known to vary widely depending upon the variety and growing conditions.  
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC) is the most relevant constituent derived from the hemp plant 
C. sativa . Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, which is found in the growing and harvested plant, is 
the biosynthetic precursor of Δ9-THC. Besides 2- COOH -Δ9-THC which is termed Δ9-THCA-A, 
another positional isomer, 4- COOH -Δ9-THC, denoted Δ9-THCA-B may occur in the hemp plant. In 
fresh plant material of  C. sativa , up to 90 % of the ‘total’ Δ9-THC is present as the non-psychoactiv e 
precursor Δ9-THCA-A (Jung et al., 2009). The rate and extent of decarboxylation of the precursor 
acids in the plant material is dependent on physical effects, in particular temperature. Four 
stereoisomers of Δ9-THC are possible, with (-)-trans- Δ9-THC being the only naturally occurring 
isomer.6 
Marijuana, hashish, cannabis oil and sinsemilla all contain concentrations of Δ9-THC exceeding that in 
the average plant material. The ratio between Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids, such as cannabinol 
(CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD) can be used for the classification of hemp plants into drug material and 
non-drug material (de Meijer et al., 1992; Lachenmeier et al., 2004).  
In the European Union (EU), varieties of hemp that are cultivated and used for feed must be listed i n 
the EU’s ‘ Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species ’. According to Regulation 
(EU) No 1307/20137 the maximum content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in these varieties is limited 
to 0.2 % (w/w). 
The hemp plant is a multi-purpose crop grown both for its fibres and seed, principally for industrial 
purposes. The outer fibres are used mainly for the production of high quality paper while the coarser 
inner fibres (also known as hurds or shives) are mainly used in manufacturing but may also be used for 
animal bedding. In 2014, just over 17 000 ha was cultivated for hemp production in 17 Member States

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 10 of the EU. This was predominantly in France (61 %), the Netherlands (8 %) and Lithuania (6 %), with 
smaller areas in the other countries. 
Four different types of feed material derived from the hemp plant are utilised as livestock feeds, 
namely hemp seed, hemp seed meal/cake, hemp seed oil and whole hemp plant, including leaves, 
flowers and stalks (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). According to the European Industrial Hemp 
Association (EIHA), the parts of the hemp plant most widely used as animal feed are whole hemp seed 
– fed mainly to fish and ornamental birds – and hemp seed oil, which is used as a feed additive for 
birds, fish and dogs. Currently, hemp oil is mainly produced for human consumption, but where it is 
used as a feed it is mainly for fish (EIHA, 2013). Hemp seed cake (the residue of the seed after oil 
extraction) may be used to replace – or be fed in conjunction with – oilseed meals, such as rape seed 
meal, in diets for livestock. Finally, the leaves, flowers and stalks (the by-product of hemp production 
for fibres and seeds) may be used as feed for ruminants and pigs, although this is currently not 
common practice in the EU. Currently, fibres extracted from the stalks of the plants are not used in 
animal feed to a great extent. 
This risk assessment concentrates on the primary psychoactive cannabinoid Δ9-THC, in particular 
(-)-trans- Δ9-THC, the only natural occurring of four possible stereoisomers in the hemp plant. It has to 
be stated, however, that the information from the literature does not always clearly indicate whether 
the data reported as ‘THC’ or ‘total THC’ refer to Δ9-THC or, for example, to the sum of Δ9-THC plus 
Δ8-THC and/or plus its non-psychoactive precursors which may form Δ9-THC during the analytical 
determination or during food and feed processing. 
1.3. Previous assessments 
In 1997, the Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV), 
r
ecommended limiting the daily intake of THC in hemp-containing foods to 1 –2 µg/kg b.w. per day. 
This was derived by applying an uncertainty factor (UF) in the range of 20 –40 to the lowest oral dose 
of
 2.5 mg THC/day which was associated with central nervous system (CNS) effects in humans , 
corresponding to around 40 µg/kg body weight (b.w .) per day for a 60 kg adult. In 2000, based on 
these levels, the BgVV proposed THC guidance values for several foods (see Section 2.1). 
In 2002, the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) evaluated the safety of THC in foods. 
The FSANZ considered it appropriate to derive a tolerable daily intake (TDI) based on the most 
sensitive known endpoint, namely skill performance in humans. The FSANZ derived the TDI from 
their interpretation of the results of a human study in which the effect of oral THC on skill 
performance, cognitive function and mood was examined at dose levels of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 
20 mg/person (Chesher et al., 1990). A lowest-observed-level effect (LOEL) was established as 
5 mg/person (which was equivalent to a dose level of 60 µg/kg b.w.). The FSANZ concluded that 
effects at this dose were minimal and reversible and no psychotropic effects were noted. The FSANZ 
applied an UF of 10 to take into account possible variability in response in the human population, 
resulting in the TDI of 6 µg/kg b.w. An updated assessment was performed by the FSANZ in 2012 in 
order to establish whether new data indicated a need to change the TDI. A review by Zuurman et al. 
(2009) and any publications subsequent to this review (up to December 2010) and additional THC 
studies, including those used in the opinion of the EFSA FEEDAP Panel (2011) were used. With 
regards to the review by Zuurman et al. (2009) the FSANZ stated: ‘The review by Zuurman et al. did 
not aim to specifically establish a threshold dose for effects observed after oral administration, 
however one of the major conclusions of the review was that the subjective reporting of feeling ‘high’ 
appeared to be the most sensitive CNS biomarker for the effects of THC. This is in contrast to the 
Chesher study which reported slightly decreased skill performance at 5 mg/person but no self-
reported feeling of intoxication at this dose. It is possible that the reported decreased skill 
performance at 5 mg/person may be an artefact of the statistical analysis used in the Chesher study. 
This possibility is supported by the analysis of the data collected at the 3rd time-point (3.3 h post-
dose) which indicated that skill performance following the 10 mg/person dose was slightly less 
impaired relative to the 5 mg/person dose. In addition, Chesher et al. reported a statistically

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 11 significant (p < 0.05) trend of performance decrement with increasing THC dose, however the paper 
did not state whether the performance decrement reported at the dose of 5 mg/person was statistically 
significant. Since a dose of 5 mg/person was associated with no subjective feeling of intoxication, and 
any association with decreased skill performance is questionable, it is considered that this dose level 
represents a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in this study ’.8 The updated assessment 
concluded that the TDI of 6 μg  /kg b.w. remained valid. 
In 2011, the EFSA  Panel on Additives and Products or Substrates used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP 
Panel) published a scientific opinion on the safety of hemp ( Cannabis genus) for use in animal feed 
(EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). A dose of 2.5 mg THC, corresponding to 0.04 mg THC/kg body 
weight (b.w.) (using a 60 kg body weight) was identified from human studies (Beal et al., 1997; 
BgVV, 1997, 2000; Ramaekers et al., 2004) as the LOEL for psychotropic effects (including euphoria, 
di
zziness, thinking abnormalities and somnolence, reduction in performance including reaction time, 
and memory function) after either single or repeated exposure. A provisional maximum tolerable daily 
intake (PMTDI) of 0.0004 mg  THC /kg b.w. was then derived by the FEEDAP Panel as follows: ‘In 
deriving a provisional maximum tolerable THC intake from the above LOEL, the BgVV applied an 
uncertainty factor between 20 and 40 taking into account inter alia the lack of knowledge concerning 
the onset and exact dose-effect relationship of the psychomotor effects of orally administered THC, the 
inter-individual differences in sensitivity to THC and possible interactions with other active 
substances in the botanical source or with alcoholic beverages or drugs taken concomitant with the 
hemp food. The BgVV recommended that the daily intake of THC with hemp food should not exceed 
0.001–0.002 mg/kg bw. The FEEDAP Panel considers it necessary to introduce in addition to the 
safety factors applied by the BgVV a further safety factor to take into account that the basis for 
deriving a provisional maximum tolerable THC intake is regarded as a LOEL. A total uncertainty 
factor of 100 applied to the LOEL would be sufficient to take account of all sources of uncertainty. ’ 
The available data allowed only exposure via milk to be calculated. The calculations used milk 
equi
valents of 2  litres (L) and 1.5 L for adults and children (1-3 years of age), respectively; a constant 
transfer rate of 0.15 %; milk yields of 15, 25 or 35 L/day ; and daily intake rates per cow of 0.5, 1.0 or 
1.5 kg dry matter of either whole hemp plant or hemp seed-derived feed material, with different THC 
content as follows: 
(a) Whole hemp plant-derived feed material with THC content of 0.2 % (maximum permitted 
content (see Council Regulation (EC) No 73/20099,10). 
(b) Whole hemp plant-derived feed material with THC content of 0.08 % (mean content observed 
in 2008 from the analytical results derived from Member State notifications to the EC). 
(c) Hemp seed-derived feed material containing as a worst case estimate 0.0012 % THC. 
In the calculations using whole hemp plant-derived feed material (with THC contents of 0.2 % or of 
0.08 %), the PMTDI was exceeded for all scenarios. For all the scenarios using hemp seed-derived 
feed material (where a worst case concentration of 0.0012 % THC was used), the resulting exposures 
were all below the PMTDI. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that it ‘does not see any option for the use 
of whole hemp plant-derived feed materials in animal nutrition. In contrast, feeding hemp seed was 
considered safe for the consumer exposed to milk from dairy cows fed the feed material ’.  
                                                 
8  The CONTAM Panel noted that Chesher et al. (1990) stated that oral THC at the doses used produced significant dose-
dependant impairment of performance for a period in excess of 3 hours (see Section 7.5.1.3).

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 12 In 2011, in response to a request from the Republic of Croatia Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Rural Development, the Croatian Food Agency published a scientific opinion concerning the impact 
on health of hemp products that are consumed (hemp oil and hemp seed s). The opinion refers to the 
acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 500 μg/day , established by Grotenhermen et al. (2001). This was 
derived from a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for psychotropic effects of 
10 (2  × 5) mg/THC person (of 70 kg b.w.) and a safety factor of 20 (10 for individual variations and 
two for extrapolation from lowest observed adverse effect level LOAEL to NOAEL) (HAH, 2011).  
In 2012, the German ‘Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung ’ (BfR) published an opinion on THC in 
feeds made from hemp and hemp products with regard to animal health and the carry-over to foods of 
animal origin. Although no concrete figures were given, the BfR concluded that for livestock it is 
possible that under worst case conditions the feeding of hemp and hemp products with THC 
concentrations of 0.2 % (the maximum permitted concentration in the hemp varieties authorised for 
cultivation in Europe) can impair the health of animals consuming it. The BfR report noted that, since 
THC is lipophilic, repeated intake via feeds may result in accumulation in the fatty tissue of animals. 
The THC concentration in meat and other foods of animal origin therefore depends on the fat content 
of the tissue, although the extent to which the individual livestock species accumulate THC in their 
tissue could not be estimated due to a lack of data. The report concluded that it has to be assumed that 
the long-term exposure of dairy cows through even low concentrations of THC in their feed leads to a 
permanent excretion of THC via milk. Thus, the BfR proposed that farmers who feed hemp or hemp 
products to their livestock be issued with feeding recommendations.

delta-9- tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV) 
Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol  ( Δ9-THC) ((6a R,10aR)-6,6,9-trimeth yl-3-pentyl-6a,7,8,10a-
tetrahydro-6H -benzo[ c]chromen-1-ol; CAS-No 1972-08-3) is an odourless light yellow resinous oil 
with the molecular formula C 21H30O2 and a molecular weight of 314.46 g/mol (Figure 1). 
Δ9-THC has a low solubility in water (2.8 mg/L at 23 °C), but good solubility in most organic 
solvents. The vapour pressure at 25 °C is 4.63 × 10-8 mm Hg and the boiling point is 200 °C at 
0.02 mm Hg. When heated to decomposition, it emits acrid smoke and irritating fumes. The 
octanol/water partition coefficient log K ow is 6.97 and the dissociation constant pKa is 10.6. The 
Henry's Law constant is 2.44 × 10-7 atm-m3/mol at 25 °C. The isomerisation of Δ9-THC to delta-8-
tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ8-THC) is documented and occurs particularly at elevated temperatures where 
the equilibrium is towards the Δ8-THC (Hazekamp, 2009). Four stereoisomers of Δ9- THC are possible: 
(
-)-trans- Δ9-THC and (+)-trans- Δ9-THC, (-)-cis- Δ9-THC and (+)-cis- Δ9-THC of which (-)-trans- Δ9-
THC is the only naturally occurring stereoisomer and primary psychoactive compound derived from 
C. sativa  (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1964; ElSohly, 2002 ). 
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acids (Δ9-THCA -A and  Δ9-THCA -B) 
The precursor of Δ9-THC in the fresh hemp plant is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Δ9-THCA). The 
formation of Δ9-THC from Δ9-THCA is a function of time, temperature and pressure. Δ9-THCA may

2. Legislation 
In this opinion, where reference is made to European legislation (Regulations, Directives, Decisions), 
the reference should be understood as relating to the most recent amendment, unless otherwise stated. 
2.1. Food 
In order to protect public health, Article 2 of the Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/9312 stipulates 
that, where necessary, maximum tolerances for specific contaminants in food shall be established. 
Thus, a number of maximum tolerances for contaminants as well as natural plant toxicants are 
currently laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006.13 Δ9-THC is not currently 
regulated under this or any other EU Regulation for food.

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 15 In the absence of harmonised regulatory levels for Δ9-THC in food, in 2000 the BgVV recommended 
guidance values ( ‘Richtwerte ’) for the content for Δ9-THC in various food commodities. The values 
were 5 µg/kg for non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, 5 000 µg/kg for edible oils and 150 µg/kg for 
al
l other foodstuffs. The values applied for the sum of Δ9-THC and the precursor Δ9-THCA in food 
commodities ready- to-eat. 
In Belgium, hemp-containing foods must be granted an exemption from the Belgian food regulations. 
The THC levels in these foods shall not exceed the following maximum levels (ML) : oil from seed: 
10 mg/kg , seeds and flour  of seeds : 5 mg/kg , and other foods and drinks : 0.2 mg/kg. These provisions 
also apply to imported hemp containing  foods .14 
Switzerland issued maximum levels for Δ9-THC of 20 mg/kg in hemp seed oil, 10 mg/kg for hemp 
seeds, 5 mg/kg for spirits (based on pure alcohol), 2 mg/kg for bakery and long-life bakery products, 
and pasta, 1 mg/kg for food of plant origin, and 0.2 mg/kg for alcoholic beverages (except spirits), 
alcohol-free beverages, and herbal and fruit tea. The ML for hemp seeds, bakery and long-life bakery 
products and pasta refer to dry weight. The ML for herbal and fruit tea refer to the ready to drink 
preparation of 15 g plant material/kg cooked in boiling water and hold at 85 °C for 30 minutes.15 
2.2. Feed 
In the EU, the production of numerous basic and certified seeds is granted provided specific 
requirements are fulfilled. Article 32(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 stipulates that areas used 
for the production of hemp shall only be eligible hectares if the varieties used have a THC content not 
exceeding 0.2 %. Commission Regulation (EU) No 68/201316 lists those feed materials that can be 
used in animal nutrition (hemp seeds, hemp expeller and hemp oil) provided the THC content 
complies with EU Legislation.  Varieties of hemp that are cultivated and used for feed must be listed in 
the EU’s ‘Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species’. Detailed requirements for 
sampling and analysis of Δ9-THC in hemp varieties are laid down in Annex I of Commis sion 
Regulation (EC) No 1122/200917 (see Section 3.2).  
Except for the maximum content of THC in hemp granted for the production of feed, no other 
harmonised maximum levels for THC in feed exist in the EU. 
3. Sample collection and methods of analysis 
3.1. Food 
There are no specific guidelines for sampling of foods to be analysed for Δ9-THC. Therefore, basic 
rules for sampling, such as for organic contaminants, should be followed. Respective requirements are 
f
or example laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 401/200618 for sampling and analysis for 
the official control of levels of aflatoxins in certain foodstuffs. This Regulation contains inter alia  a 
number of provisions concerning methods of sampling depending on the size of the lot, packaging,

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 16 transport, storage, sealing and labelling. The primary objective is to obtain a representative and 
homogeneous laboratory sample with no secondary contamination. 
Numerous methods for the determination of Δ9-THC have been described in the literature. While the 
majority of the publications concern the detection of Δ9-THC in serum, urine or hair following abuse 
of cannabis, methods for the determination of Δ9-THC in food are scarce. 
Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following liquid-liquid extraction 
(LLE) or solid phase microextraction is the method of choice for the determination of Δ9-THC and 
other cannabinoids in hemp containing food products. Other methods that are occasionally applied are 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with ultraviolet (UV) or fluoresc ence 
detection (Lachenmeier et al., 2004; Lachenmeier and Walch, 2005). Often the analytical procedures 
using GC comprise, in addition to Δ9-THC, also the corresponding precursors Δ9- THCA-A and 
Δ9-THCA- B which ha ve no psychotropic effects, but decarboxylate into the psychotropic Δ9-THC at 
those temperatures that are needed for volatilization and gas chromatographic separation of the 
analytes. In contrast, the lower temperatures applied in HPLC analyses generally do not result in a 
decarboxylation and thus may reveal lower Δ9-THC levels compared to gas chromatography ( GC) 
analyses. A separate determination of Δ9-THC and its precursors is possible by derivatization, such as 
silylation of the extract prior to GC analysis or by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). 
3.2. Feed 
Detailed requirements for sampling with special emphasis on sampling time, part of the crop to be 
sampled, sample size and drying and storage of the hemp samples are laid down in Annex 1 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009. In addition, this Regulation stipulates how the test 
sample has to be prepared prior to extraction and analytical determination of Δ9-THC by capillary gas 
chromatography with flame ionisation detection ( GC-FID).  
The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain Panel (CONTAM Panel) concluded that the 
prescribed analytical method is not able to differentiate between the psychoactive Δ9-THC and the 
non-psychoactive precursor acids, but generates the sum of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids which are 
generally occurring in the hemp plant at considerably higher concentrations than Δ9-THC. 
3.3. Reference materials 
A number of native and isotope-lab elled reference standards for Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids are 
commercially available. In contrast, commercially available certified reference materials for food and 
feed containing Δ9-THC and/or other cannabinoids could not be identified. 
4. Occurrence of tetrahydrocannabinol in food of animal origin and feed 
4.1.
 Previously reported occurrence results 
Almost no data are available in the literature on the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other 
food of animal origin. One study from Ahmad and Ahmad (1990), evaluated the passive human 
exposure to Δ9-THC through the consumption of buffalo milk from animals that consumed hemp 
plants (5-10 % of the total vegetation consumed). In this study, 10 samples of buffalo milk from 
different ranches were analysed by GC-MS for the presence of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC. The 
presence of Δ9-THC was not assessed. Five samples were below the limit of detection (LOD) 
(5 ng/mL) while among the quantified samples, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC values ranged between 
32 ng/mL and 173 ng/mL (average concentration = 51 ng/mL, n = 10).  Lachenmeier et al. (2004), 
determined different cannabinoids in hemp food products, such as Δ9-THC, CBD, and CBN. The food 
products were analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by on- fibre 
derivatisation, and by LLE. Among the different food products, four milk-containing samples were 
analysed; using the HS-SPME technique, in three samples of milk chocolate Δ9-THC levels ranged

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 17 between 0.03 mg/kg and 0.10 mg/kg while in one sample of coffee-flavoured whole milk chocolate 
the Δ9-THC concentration was 0.05 mg/kg. Similar values were reported using LLE. The sample with 
the highest concentration of Δ9-THC corresponded to a sample of Swiss chocolate with a ratio 
(Δ9-THC+CBN)/CBD) greater than 1. This ratio points to a classification of the cannabis plant as a 
drug-type. Ratios less than 1 seem to indicate fibre-type plants (Lachenmeier et al., 2004). 
Δ9-THC levels of 0.233 and 0.241 mg/L were reported in two milk samples collected on different days 
from cows that consumed pellets prepared from the whole hemp plant (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011) . 
The THC content of the pellets, measured as total THC, was 6 500 mg/kg (daily dose of 3 250 mg of 
total THC) (see Section 7.2 for further details of this study ). 
Concerning food of non-animal origin, the main analyses on the presence of cannabinoids have been 
focused on hemp oil, hemp seeds and hemp leaves used for infusions.  
4.2. Current occurrence results 
Initially, no data on the presence of any cannabinoids in food were available in the EFSA database. 
The EFSA Advisory Forum, the EFSA Chemical Occurrence Network, and public institutions, such as 
RIKILT were contacted to try to obtain food/feed occurrence data for these compounds.  
By the end of June 2014, different types of analytical data had been submitted by Member States and 
Switzerland into the EFSA database amounting to a total of 603 analytical results; among them 
281 analytical results were on food. A total of 322 analytical results on feed were also available, with 
261 referring to hemp plants collected and analysed following the procedure described in Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009. While most of the data were reported as Δ9-THC, some analytical 
results were reported as THC. In addition, a few samples were also reported as CBD  and C BN. 
Individual data on levels of THC in hemp plants used in the EFSA FEEDAP Scientific Opinion (2011) 
were also available, together with some aggregated data on THC in hemp plants collected between 
2009–2012 and provided by the EC.  
At the beginning of 2015, data for a few samples of plant origin were received (10 samples); these 
samples were not included in this report since the scientific opinion was close to its end and the 
samples were not adequate for dietary exposure calculations.  
In addition to these analytical data, some further data on levels of cannabinoids in food and feed were 
provided at a later stage by the EIHA and the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office 
(FSVO). These data were not submitted following the Standard Sample Description for Food and Feed 
(EFSA, 2010a). After a careful evaluation of the data, the  CONTAM Panel decided to consider them 
to estimate dietary exposure; they are shown separately from the data initially received.  
4.2.1.  Data submitted by Member States and Switzerland 
Without considering the aggregated data and the data used in the EFSA FEEDAP Scientific Opinion 
(2011), the occurrence data were provided by eight different European countries: Estonia, the 
Netherlands, Hungary, Croatia, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Switzerland. In order to guarantee an 
appropriate quality of the data, the initial dataset was carefully evaluated and the data providers 
contacted whenever it was needed to obtain further information on the submitted data. The data 
submission to EFSA followed the requirements of the EFSA Guidance on Standard Sample 
Description for Food and Feed (EFSA, 2010a ). 
A total of 33 analytical results were eliminated from the initial dataset, including 30 samples of hemp 
seeds dedicated to sowing. One sample reported o nly as ‘liquid’ (two analytical results) was excluded 
from the final dataset as further information needed for an appropriate codification was missing and it 
could not be retrieved from the data provider. Finally, a sample of ‘unspecified herb s for infusion ’ was 
also excluded following the request from the data provider, who asked for this since they could not

570 analytical results.  
4.2.1.1.  Distribution of samples across different categories 
Distribution of food samples across sampling countries and sampling years  
A total of 2 81 analytical results on cannabinoids in food were available  in the final dataset  from food 
samples collected in six different countries between 2000 and 2013. Among these 2 81 analytical 
results, 171 were reported as Δ9-THC , 103 as tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC) , four as CBD , two as the 
sum of isomers of tetrahydrocannabinol, and one as CBN . 
The 2 81 analytical results accounted for a total of 2 76 samples as five samples reported data on 
THC /Δ9-THC  and CBD /CBN  together. The available food samples divided by sampling country and 
sampling year are shown in Figure 2.

A total of 289 analytical results on cannabinoids in feed were available  in the final dataset  from feed 
samples collected in three different countries between 2008  and 2013. Among these 289 analytical 
results, 230 were reported as Δ9-THC , 54 as tetrahydrocannabinol, and five as CBD . The 
289 analytical results accounted for a total of 284 samples as five samples reported data on Δ9-THC 
and CBD  together. The available feed samples divided by sampling country and sampling year are

4.2.1.2.  Analytical methods used  
Two analytical techniques were reported for the submitted data for the analysis of cannabinoids on 
food and feed, i.e. HPLC and gas chromatography (GC). The use of HPLC was reported without 
further information on the detection method or with the use of mass spectrometry (MS) or diode array 
detector (DAD). Regarding GC, most of the samples reported the use of flame ionization detector 
(FID) although MS was also used, and in several cases no information was provided on the coupled 
detection method.  
The sensitivity of the analytical methods varied considerably depending on the matrix to be analysed. 
Considering only the analytical results that reported detection methods, in the analysis of food samples 
the highest sensitivity was observed for a GC-MS method used to analyse hemp seeds (limit of 
quantification (LOQ) = 0.2 µg/kg). For other samples analysed by GC-MS, the sensitivity ranged 
between 0.4  g/kg and 2 630  g/kg (both for samples of hemp oil). Similar sensitivity was achieved 
using GC-FID with a reported LOQ of 1.5 µg/kg (for a sample of soft-drinks), with the highest 
reported LOQ being 300 000 µg/kg (for a sample of biscuits reported as suspect, containing 
406 000 µg /kg). For the samples analysed using HPLC, the most sensitive method was an HPLC-DAD 
m
ethod used to analyse soft drinks (LOQ = 20  g/kg), while the lowest LOQ reported for HPLC-
MS/MS methods was 200 g/kg for different food matrices. For both methods, HPLC- MS/MS and 
HPLC-DAD, the lowest sensitivity corresponded to LOQs reported as 5 000 µg/kg (for the analysis of 
hemp oil samples). 
Concerning the analysis of feed samples, the highest sensitivity was observed for GC-MS with a 
reported LOQ of 15 g/kg (for the samples of hemp seed). Since most of the feed samples reported 
referred to the analysis of the hemp plant, GC-FID was the selected method as indicated in the 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009. When analysed according to this Regulation, relatively 
high concentrations of cannabinoids are expected in the hemp plant, and this leads to the use of 
methods that are not very sensitive but just fit for purpose (LOQ = 100 mg/kg).  
4.2.1.3.  O
ccurrence data by food category 
When referring to the occurrence data for food, those samples that reported Δ9-THC, 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or the sum of isomers of tetrahydrocannabinol were all considered as 
reporting Δ9-THC. 
Almost half of the analytical results on food (132 out of 281) were left-censored (LC) (below 
LOD/LOQ). The food category with the highest number of left-censored data was ‘Non alcoholic 
beverages (except milk based beverages)’, specifically samples of ‘Soft drinks’ and ‘Tea (infusion)’. 
The left- censored data were treated by the substitution method as recommended in the ‘Principles and 
 18314732, 2015, 6, Downloaded from https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4141, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal  origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 20 Methods for the Risk Assessment of Chemicals in Food’ (WHO/IPCS, 2009). The same method is 
indicated in the EFSA scientific report ‘Management of left -censored data in dietary exposure 
assessment of chemical substances’ (EFSA, 2010b) as an option in the treatment of left-censored data. 
The guidance suggests that the lower-bound (LB) and upper-bound (UB) approach should be used for 
chemicals likely to be present in the food (e.g. naturally occurring contaminants, nutrients and 
mycotoxins). At the LB, results below the LOQ and LOD were replaced by zero; at the UB the results 
below the LOD were replaced by the numerical value of the LOD and those below the LOQ were 
replaced by the value reported as LOQ.  
Only very few samples of animal origin were reported, i.e. two samples of cheese, and two samples 
reported as meat products. They are shown in Table 1 together with 10 samples of chocolate and 
chocolate products. In two of the four quantified samples of chocolate the presence of hemp seeds is 
reported, and it seems plausible that the quantified THC has its origin in these seeds. For the 
remaining samples of chocolate the source of THC is not clear, although for at least one of the 
sample s, the reported value of 42 000 µg/kg seems to indicate an origin based on the presence of hemp 
seeds or other parts of hemp plants . The two samples of cheese with a Δ9-THC mean value of 
300 µg/kg reported the presence of hemp seeds in their composition. Finally, the two products 
reported as meat products were described one as ‘cold meat with hemp’ and the other as ‘cooked 
sausage’. While in the first sample no cannabinoids were found, the cooked sausage reported the 
presence of 39 µg/kg of THC. Although the presence of herbs is not reported for this particular 
sausage, the use of dried/fresh herbs in the preparation of sausages with the aim of adding different 
flavours is common. Therefore, the use of different parts of hemp plants or hemp seeds should be the 
most probable reason to explain the THC levels found here. 
Regarding the samples of plant origin, after the 68 samples of ‘Tea (infusion)’ (FoodEx Level 2) the 
most reported samples were ‘hemp seed oil’ and ‘hemp seeds’ with 60 and 32 analytical results for 
THC, respectively ( Appendix A) . For ‘hemp seed oil’ and ‘hemp seeds’ , Δ9-THC values described in 
the literature are usually below 1 000 µg/kg (Ross et al., 2000). The mean value reported for ‘hemp 
seeds’  in the EFSA database (557 µg/kg, LB) agrees with this value. The mean values reported in the 
EFSA  database for ’hemp seed oil’ were rather higher ( 6 280 µg/kg, LB) than those found in the 
‘hemp seeds’, with one sample of cold pressed hemp oil that reported 23 2 800 µg/kg of THC. 
Although, as mentioned above, the levels of Δ9-THC in ‘hemp seed oil’ are usually below 
1 000 µg/kg, in certain occasions values that range between 6 200 µg/kg and 31 700 µg/kg have been 
r
eported (Leson et al., 2001). Even higher levels of Δ9-THC are described in the literature for ‘hemp 
oil’ (maxim um = 117 500 µg/kg) although specific information on whether the oil was produced from 
cold pressed seeds or other parts of the hemp plant is not reported (Holler et al., 2008). Moreover, the 
use of hemp plants that belong either to ‘drug -type’ or ‘fib re-type’ varieties will clearly influence the 
levels of THC in the hemp seed oil. The oil produced by pressing the hemp seeds should not be 
confused with essential oils which are produced by the distillation of other parts of the hemp plant, 
such as buds and leaves, and may contain much higher amounts of cannabinoids than the hemp seed 
oil (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). High levels of Δ9-THC in ‘hemp seeds’ and ‘hemp seed oil’ seem to 
be, in general, due to cross-contamination with the plant leaves during processing as only very small 
levels of Δ9-THC are found in the seed itself (Ross et al., 2000). Among the quantified samples, the 
reported concentrations of cannabinoids varied between 0.98 µg/kg quantified in a sample of soft 
drink flavoured with herbs, and 406 000 µg/kg reported in a sample of biscuits. 
As previously mentioned, five samples reported data on CBD (four) and CBN  (one) together with data 
on THC/ Δ9-THC. In two cases when CBD  was reported (two samples of unspecified tea/herb 
infusions) its concentration was around 10-fold higher than that quantified for Δ9-THC. In one case (a 
tea sample), neither CBD  nor Δ9-THC were quantified while in a sample of unspecified fruit juice only 
CBD  
was quantified. In a sample of unspecified soft drink analysed for the presence of CBN   and 
THC, none of them were detected.

When referring to the occurrence data for feed, those samples that reported Δ9-THC, 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or the sum of tetrahydrocannabinol isomers, were all considered as 
reporting Δ9-THC. 
Around 25 % of the analytical results (75) were left-censored data; as done for the data on food they 
were treated by the substitution method (WHO/IPCS, 2009).  
There were three different types of feed samples: hemp seeds, hemp pellets, and samples of hemp plants 
analysed following Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 (Table 2).  Twenty-three samples 
initially reported as hemp fibre were re-codified as hemp plants since the method of analysis used was 
that described in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 and their THC levels did not differ from 
those reported for hemp plants.

Figure 4:  Distribution of the analytical results on THC in hemp plant samples from different years  
The most recent analytical data on hemp plants (2008 –2013) seem to indicate the presence of lower 
mean levels of THC as compared to the hemp plants analysed between 2006 –2008 (those used in the 
FEEDAP opinion (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011)). However, unlike the data collected between 2006 –
2008 that came from 21 countries, the most recent data come from hemp plants collected only in two 
countries; therefore, any conclusion should be drawn very carefully. In addition, further aggregated data 
provided by the EC for samples collected between 2009 –2012 make reference to several samples above 
the maximum THC levels specified in legislation (> 0.2 %), and with average values often above 0.1 %. 
The CONTAM Panel decided not to use the 603 available analytical results on cannabinoids, 281 on 
food and 322 on feed, to estimate dietary exposure to Δ9-THC. This decision was based on the fact that 
in many cases the data represented the sum of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids since they were analysed 
by GC- MS or by GC-FID each without prior derivatization , and in other cases the presence of Δ9-THC 
was not confirmed. Likewise, the data on levels of THC in hemp plants used in the EFSA FEEDAP 
Scientific Opinion (2011) and those provided by the EC were not considered suitable for the exposure 
assessment as they do not differentiate between Δ9-THC and its precursor acids 
4.2.2.  Data submitted by the European Industrial Hemp Association and the Swiss Federal 
Food Safety and Veterinary Office 
Following the submission of the analytical data described in Section 4.2.1, further data were submitted 
at a later stage by the EIHA and the FSVO. Although these data were not submitted following the 
Standard Sample Description for Food and Feed (EFSA, 2010a), after a careful evaluation the 
CONTAM Panel decided to consider them for dietary exposure estimations.  
4.2.2.1.  Data from th e European Industrial Hemp Association  
Some analytical data for diverse hemp products available in Europe were provided by the EIHA; these 
samples were analysed in Germany in October-November 2014. The values, reported as mg/kg, show 
the levels of ∆9-THC, ∆9-THCA and total THC content. The reported total THC content refers to total 
∆9-THC, and it was calculated summing up the content of ∆9-THC and ∆9-THCA, where ∆9-THCA is

Food samples 
Average values were provided by the EIHA for different types of hemp-related food samples. In most of 
the cases, no information was reported on the number of samples used to derive the mean values. 
Among the different products, the highest mean values were reported for hemp oil, in particular in 
conventional and refined hemp oil; the lowest concentrations were reported for bittersweet chocolate 
and milk chocolate (Table 4). The chocolate products contain in both cases hemp seeds at 12 % of its 
total weight, which most probably explains the presence of cannabinoids in these samples since no milk 
from cows fed with hemp plants or hemp by-products was used to elaborate the chocolate.

(a):  In these samples Δ9-THCA -B was never present in detectable amounts.  
4.3. Feed and food processing 
Hemp is a multi-purpose crop grown both for its fibres and seeds. About 70 % of the outer fibres are 
used for the production of high quality paper, with the remainder used in the automotive industry and 
for insulating, while the coarser inner fibres (also known as hurds or shives) are used as animal bedding, 
principally for horses and pets, in the building sector (Karus, 2005). Since the fibre and hurds are not 
used as either food or feed, the effects of processing these are not considered here. 
As discussed in Section 1, up to 90 % of the total THC in C . sativa  plants may be present as the non-
psychoactive precursor ∆9-THCA-A (Jung et al., 2009). The highest concentrations of Δ9-THC are 
found in the sticky resin produced most abundantly in the bracts of the female flowers and upper leaves 
of the female plant before seed maturity (Karimi and Hayyatghaibi, 2006). In contrast, concentrations of 
Δ9-THC in seeds and products derived from them are low, although may be present in measurable 
amounts (Mölleken and Husmann, 1997). The presence of Δ9-THC in hemp seeds has been attributed 
largely to external contact of the seed hull with the cannabinoid-containing resins in bracts and leaves 
during maturation, harvesting, and processing, since the majority of Δ9-THC has been located on the 
outside of the seed hulls (Ross et al., 2000). However, seed kernels do not appear to be entirely Δ9-THC 
free, and may contain up to 0.5 µg/g of Δ9-THC, depending on the hemp variety (Ross et al., 2000). If 
the plant is grown for seed production or seed-derived products, resin production will have declined by 
the time the seeds are harvested (Ross et al., 2000).

=== PAGINA 26 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 26 The main processes applied to the seeds are de-hulling and oil extraction. De-hulling is a physical 
process in which the kernel is separated from the outer seed coat (testa). Ross et al. (2000) showed that 
when the seeds were separated into the kernel and testa, the bulk of Δ9-THC was located in the testa, 
mainly on the outside. The authors speculated that this was possibly the result of physical interaction 
with plant leaves during processing. It is likely therefore, that concentrations of Δ9-THC are reduced in 
de-hulled seeds but increased in residual bran.  
Oil extraction from the de-hulled seed is usually by cold pressing, in contrast to conventionally 
extracted oil from ground oilseed meals which make use of organic solvents such as hexane, followed 
by solvent evaporation. Although pressing and grinding produces heat through friction, the temperature 
must not rise above 49 °C for any oil to be considered cold pressed. In practice, cold pressed oils are 
produced at even lower temperatures, thereby retaining their aromatic and nutritional properties. Since 
Δ9-THC is found predominantly in the leaves and flowers of the hemp plant, only trace amounts of 
Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids can be detected in foods that are made from hempseed (Callaway, 
2004). However, when oil is pressed from the poorly cleaned seed of hemp varieties (e.g. Chinese 
hempseed), levels of >1 % Δ9-THC have been reported (Callaway et al., 1997). 
Δ9-
THC generally occurs in hemp plants at low concentrations. Rather, it is predominantly present as 
∆9-THCA-A and ∆9-THCA-B which are found in the growing and harvested plant, and are the 
biosynthetic precursors of ∆9-THC. When heated as in cooking or smoking, the precursors are rapidly 
converted to ∆9-THC as a result of decarboxylation. The rate and extent of decarboxylation of ∆9-THCA 
in the plant material is dependent on physical effects, in particular temperature.  
The EFSA  FEEDAP Panel (2011) concluded that feed materials derived from the whole hemp plant or 
from products derived from the hemp plant (hemp flour obtained from ground dried hemp leaves) are 
not subjected to any processing that would increase the natural ∆9-THC content. 
As discussed in Sections 7.1.6.1. and 7.2, the non-psychoactive metabolite, 11-nor-9-carboxy -∆9-THC , 
may be present in milk from cows given feed derived from C. sativa . The CONTAM Panel was not 
aware of any studies that have examined the e ffects of processing – and in particular exposure to heat - 
of animal products on the conversion of precursor acids  to the psychoactive form. In the case of milk, 
most commercially produced milk is subjected to pasteurisation prior to marketing and consump tion, 
when it is exposed to temperatures typically between 62.8  °C (for 30 minutes in batch processes) and 
71.7 °C (for 15 sec onds  for a continuous processes). Veress et al . (1990) examined  the rate of 
decarboxylation of cannabinoids from ground marijuana at temperature s between 80  °C and 145  °C 
over the time range of 0 –60 minutes. The rate of decarboxylation at a temperature of 80 °C f or up to one 
hour was very low . 
In conclusion, as high temperatures are not generated during de-hulling and oil extraction, these 
processes are not expected to result in increased levels of ∆9-THC in the oil or meal resulting from 
decarboxylation of precursor acids. Although most milk is subjected to pasteurisation prior to marketing 
and consumption, the temperatures used are unlikely to result in decarboxylation of any non-
psychoactive precursors that may be present as a result of transfer from feed.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 27 toddlers was used to calculate the dietary exposure in these two age classes (EFSA Scientific 
Committee, 2012). 
5.2. Feed consumption 
Four different types of feed material derived from the hemp plant are utilised as livestock feeds, namely 
hemp seed, hemp seed meal/cake, hemp seed oil and whole hemp plant, including leaves, flowers and 
stalks (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). According to the EIHA, the parts of the hemp plant most widely 
used as animal feed are whole hemp seed – fed mainly to exotic birds and fish – and hemp seed oil, 
which is used as a feed additive for birds, fish and dogs. Currently, hemp oil is mainly used to mix with 
protein feed for Koi Carp (EIHA, 2013). Hemp seed cake (the residue of the seed after oil extraction) 
may be used to replace – or be fed in conjunction with – oilseed meals, such as rape seed meal, in diets 
for cows, pigs and horses. Finally, the leaves, flowers and stalks, (the by-product of hemp production 
for fibres and seeds), may be used as feed for ruminants and pigs, but this is currently not common 
practice. Currently, fibres extracted from the stalks of the plants are not used in animal feed. 
According to the EIHA (2013), hemp seed production in Europe in 2013 reached 9 000 tonnes, 78 % of 
which originated in France, while a further 9 000 tonnes were imported, mainly from China. Most of 
this (67 %) was used as whole seeds for birds and fish. Approximately 2 000 tonnes was de-hulled, most 
(
80 %) of which was used as animal feed, while a further 2 000 tonnes was processed for oil production. 
Since the oil is the most valuable product, it is almost entirely used for human food, with small amounts 
used for cosmetics and for animal feed. Approximately 5 % of the seeds are consumed as food (EIHA, 
2013).  
Although all parts of the Cannabis  plant may contain cannabinoids (Lachenmeier and Walch, 2005), the 
highest concentrations are found in the sticky resin produced in the flowering tops of female plants. 
Furthermore, in the fresh plant up to 90 % of the cannabinoids are in the form of Δ9-THCA, with typical 
ratios ( Δ9-THC: Δ9-THCA) between 1:9 and 1:20 (Pitts, 1992; Brenneisen, 1984). The ratio will be the 
same in all parts of the plant, since freshly produced Δ9-THCA will be subjected to the same oxidative 
conditions, thus producing Δ9-THC at the same rate relative to time and environmental conditions. 
A
ccording to the EIHA, the only area currently exclusively dedicated to growing hemp as animal feed is 
in the Netherlands, where approximately 300 ha of hemp are grown for use as cattle feed. The hemp is 
chopped after flowering with a forage harvester and baled.  
As will be apparent from the above, hemp and products derived from it are not widely used as feeds in 
the EU.  
6. Human dietary exposure to THC /∆9- THC 
Since almost no data on ∆9-THC levels in milk or other foods of animal origin were available, the 
CONTAM Panel decided to estimate human dietary exposure to ∆9-THC using different assumptions. 
These assumptions refer to the presence of ∆9-THC in he mp-derived feed materials, the transfer rate 
from feed to milk, the daily milk yield, the daily feed consumption and the human consumption of milk 
and dairy products. Since the values used for the consumption of milk and dairy products are based on 
high consumption per day (95 th percentile values of only consumers), the exposure estimates refer to 
acute dietary exposure. Dietary exposure to ∆9-THC via consumption of animal tissues and eggs could 
not be performed, due to a lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC. 
6.1. Scenarios used to assess human acute dietary exposure to total THC 
(Δ9-THC + precursor acids) 
When ass essing the different variables involved in the estimation of the dietary exposure to  total THC, a 
very broad range of values could be used to reflect the concentration of total THC/∆9-THC in the feed 
materials depending whether one refers to the use of the whole hemp plant or hemp seed-derived 
materials. Obviously, this fact has a substantial impact on the estimates of dietary exposure. In its

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 28 scientific opinion on the safety of hemp ( Cannabis  genus) for use as animal feed, the FEEDAP Panel 
considered different scenarios regarding the total THC content in feed materials derived from the whole 
hemp plant (together with some other scenarios assuming also the use of hemp seed-derived materials) 
(EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). For the total THC content in feed materi als produced from the whole 
hemp plant, the FEEDAP Panel used a value of 0.2 % total THC (2 g/kg) based on the ML for hemp 
plants described in the then effective Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, and a value of 0.08 % total 
THC (0.8 g/kg) based on the average total THC content in hemp plants reported to the EC by the 
Member States in  2008. 
In the current Scientific Opinion, a worst case scenario using the variables described in  Section 6.2., was 
assessed assuming the use of whole hemp plants to produce feed materials. However, in contrast to 
Section 6.2., for the presence of ∆9-THC in the feed material, THC at the ML indicated by the EU 
legislation (2 g/kg) was applied (assuming all THC as ∆9-THC). Considering high consumption of milk 
and dairy products, this would result in acute exposure estimates between 3.4–5.4 µg/kg b.w. day for 
adults and 15.0–23.4 µg/kg b.w. day in toddlers, depending on the milk production rate and feed 
consumption. Acute exposure from the consumption of milk and dairy products was also estimated 
considering the use of whole hemp plants with mean THC concentrations of 0.8 g/kg and 0.3 g/kg. 
These THC levels come from two datasets with measured levels of THC in hemp plants, one from the 
data used in the FEEDAP Panel and the other from recent data submitted to  EFSA  (see Section 4.2.1.4). 
These scenarios led to acute exposure levels ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 µg/kg b.w. day in adults and from 
2.3 to  9.4 µg/kg b.w. day in  toddlers, depending on the milk production rate and feed consumption. 
Taking into account that these values come from the analysis of the upper 30 cm-parts of hemp plants 
with female inflorescences, i.e. where the highest concentration of total THC is found, the presence of 
0.03 %, 0.08 % and 0.2 % total THC in  the feed material produced from the whole plant is  considered by 
the CONTAM Panel as too conservative. What it is even more important, these values were obtained by 
the official gas chromatographic method prescribed in legislation which does not distinguish between 
the psychoactive Δ9-THC and its non-psychoactive precursor acids; no data were available on the levels 
of Δ9-THC in these samples. Moreover, according to the EIHA, the use of leaves, flowers and stalks 
from the hemp plant to feed ruminants and pigs is  not common practice.  
6.2. Scenarios used to assess human acute dietary exposure to ∆9-THC 
Different values were proposed for the following five variables used to estimate dietary exposure to 
∆9-THC: the presence of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed materials, the transfer rate from feed to 
milk, the daily milk yield (L/cow), the daily feed consumption and the human consumption of milk and 
dairy products (Table 7). The combination of these variables resulted in different acute exposure 
estimates to ∆9-THC as shown in Table 7.  
Presence of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed materials 
As already mentioned in this opinion, the hemp seed cake (the residue of the seed after oil extraction) is 
used to replace – or be fed in conjunction with – oilseed meals, such as rape seed meal, in diets for 
cows, pigs and horses. Analytical data from industry (EIHA) on the presence of ∆9-THC in hemp 
flour/hemp protein powder were available (Table 4), together with samples of pelleted hempseed meal 
from the FSVO (Table 6). The two values assigned to the hemp seed-derived materials in the scenarios 
described in Table 7 (0.8 mg/kg and 11 mg/kg) were derived from these analytical data.   
Transfer rate 
There are no studies on the potential transfer of ∆9-THC into milk from the feed material consumed by 
the cows, beyond a preliminary experiment performed at the Swiss Center for Agriculture (Guidon and 
Zoller, 1999) and an unpublished study describing a field case (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). Based on 
both studies which showed transfer rates between 0.10 and 0.15 %, the transfer rate selected was 
0.15 %, and it was used across all the different scenarios.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 29 Daily milk yield and daily feed consumption 
These two variables are intimately related to each other; the lower the amount of milk produced, the 
lower is the daily feed consumption, and vice versa. To assess exposure by livestock, two different milk 
yields are considered, 20 L/day and 40 L/day. For a milk yield of 20 L/day, a daily feed consumption of 
15.8 kg dry matter has been assumed (AFRC, 1993), of which 40 % (6.3 kg) is compound feed, 
cont
aining 1.25 kg (20 %) of hemp seed cake. At the higher level of milk production (40 L/day), the 
total daily feed intake of 20.7 kg dry matter (AFRC, 1993) has been assumed. Again, it has been 
assumed that 40 % of this is compound feed, and within the compound feed 20 % is hemp meal, 
providing a consumption of 1.6 kg hemp seed cake/day. 
Milk consumption 
Default values for high acute intake of milk including dairy products in adults (18 –65 years of age) and 
toddlers (1 –3 years of age) were the same as used in the EFSA FEEDAP Panel opinion (2011). These 
values were 2 L of milk for adults and 1.5 L for toddlers. To calculate the dietary exposure a default 
body weight value of 70 kg was used for adults and 12 kg for toddlers (EFSA, 2012).  
The different variables were combined in different scenarios to estimate acute dietary exposure to 
∆9-THC (Table 7). For adults, the exposure estimations ranged between 0.0010 µg/kg b.w. per day and 
0.029 µg/kg b.w. per day, the latter obtained under the scenario 20 L milk yield and 11 mg/kg of 
∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived materials. In toddlers, the exposure estimations ranged between 
0.0060 µg/kg b.w. per day and 0.13 µg/kg b.w. per day, the latter also obtained under the scenario 20 L 
milk yield and 11 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived materials.  
Specific (vulnerable) groups 
As pregnant women are not considered different from other population groups with respect to 
consumption of dairy products, the CONTAM Panel concluded that a separate exposure scenario was 
not needed. 
Concluding remark 
The CONTAM Panel emphasised that there is considerable uncertainty associated with the different 
exposure estimates described in Table 7. For the interpretation of the results, the following points hav e 
to be taken into account. First, the selection of values that describe the presence of ∆9-THC in hemp 
seed-derived materials is based on a very limited number of samples. Then, the applied transfer rate of 
∆9-THC into cow milk is based on only two investigations, one of them being a study with only one cow 
and the other, a field case. Moreover, information on the fate of the precursor ∆9-THCA in the rumen of 
the cow and its extent of possible transformation into ∆9-THC, on the conversion of ∆9-THC into less 
psychoactive metabolites, and the impact of raw milk processing are lacking.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 31 7. Hazard identification and characterisation 
7.1. Toxicokinetics 
The Δ9-THC kinetics in humans and laboratory animals has been the subject of several reviews 
(Agurell et al., 1986; IPCS-INCHEM, 1989; NTP, 1996; Grotenhermen, 2003; Huestis, 2007).  
7.1.1.  Absorption 
As detailed in Section 1.4 (Figure 1) a non- psychoactive ∆9-THC pr ecursor (∆9-THCA-A) occurs in 
hemp. ∆9-THCA-A may be absorbed by different routes, including the oral one, and has been found at 
trace levels in blood and urine from cannabis smokers (Jung et al., 2007).  
Despite its high lipophilicity, Δ9-THC is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the gastrointestinal 
tract, due to partial degradation at gastric pH; the oral exposure results in lower and more-delayed 
peak ∆9-THC concentrations and a lower bioavailability (up to 20 %) compared to other routes (i.e. 
i
nhalatory, intravenous (i.v.)) also because of an extensive hepatic metabolism (first-pass effect).  
According to studies performed in laboratory animals, the oral bioavailability and the distribution of 
the drug may be affected by the expression of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent efflux 
drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Bonhomme-Faivre et al., 2008). After a single oral exposure, 
peak plasma concentrations of Δ9-THC are reached in few hours (0.5 –4) in mice (Bonhomme-Faivre 
et
 al., 2008), cats (McCarthy et al., 1984), and rats (Abel and Subramanian, 1990). The maximal 
plasma concentration was increased by about 1.7 fold in P-gp (mdr1a-/-) deficient mice (Bonhomme-
Faivre et al., 2008). Information about oral bioavailability in experimental animals is scant. In Rhesus 
monkeys, the apparent bioavailability of Δ9-THC (single oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg b.w. in gelatine 
capsule) amounted to 26 ± 14 % (Perlin et al., 1985).  
In human studies 1 to 5 hours after oral ingestion of 20 mg of Δ9-THC (via a chocolate cookie),  peak 
Δ9-THC concentrations were observed ranging from 4.4 to 11 ng/mL, with oral bioavailability 
es
timated at 6 % (Huestis, 2007).  
In a controlled study by Goodwin et al. (2006), six volunteers with a history of cannabis use were 
orally administered Δ9-THC at total daily doses of 0.39, 0.47, 7.5 or 14.8 mg Δ9- THC. Other 
treatments also included either hemp oil (0.39 and 14.8 mg  Δ9-THC/day), or dronabinol (synthetic 
Δ9-THC) capsules (7.5 mg Δ9-THC/day) in three divided doses each day for 5 consecutive days. 
Blood samples were collected during and after dosing and plasma concentrations of Δ9-THC and its 
main metabolites 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were determined by GC-MS. At the 
lowest doses (0.39 and 0.47 mg  Δ9-THC/day), neither Δ9-THC nor 11- OH-Δ9-THC were detected 
(LOQ 0.5 ng/mL), however for 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC, maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
was 3.1 ng/mL. At the two highest doses (7.5 and 14.8 mg Δ9-THC/day), plasma concentrations of 
Δ9-THC and 11- OH-Δ9-THC were of the same order of magnitude (range 0.6 –6.1 ng/mL), while those 
of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were much higher (range 10.6 –43.0 ng/mL). Plasma Δ9-THC and 11-
OH-Δ9-THC concentrations were not quantifiable at any dose within 15.5 hours after the last dose, 
whereas 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC could be detected at any time and for at least 39.5 hours. The 
study indicates that plasma 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC is a good indicator of the oral exposure to 
Δ9-THC as it is detectable at higher concentrations and for a longer time compared to the parent 
compound and 11- OH-Δ9-THC irrespective of the source of Δ9-THC. 
In another study (Schwilke et al., 2009), involving six adult males who smoked cannabis daily, free 
plasma Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were determined following oral 
administration of 20 mg Δ9-THC (dronabinol) every 4 to 8 hours (giving total daily doses of 40 –
120 mg Δ9-THC) for 7 days. Prior to the first day of controlled dosing, mean free plasma 
concentrations for Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were determined as 4.3, 
1.3 and 34.0 μg/L, respectively. During dosing a steady increase in both metabolites was observed

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 32 whereas for Δ9-THC this did not occur. At 22.5 hours after the final dose, mean free peak plasma 
concentrations for Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were 3.8, 3.0, 196.9 μg/L, 
respectively. 
An increase in absorption of Δ9-THC was reported by Lukas and Orozco (2001) when male 
volunteers consumed ethanol before smoking marijuana. Plasma Δ9-THC levels and changes in 
subjective mood states were recorded 90 minutes after smoking. When the volunteers consumed 
ethanol, higher plasma Δ9-THC levels were noted, marijuana effects were detected sooner and more 
episodes of euphoria occurred, compared to those receiving the corresponding control for the ethanol 
treatment. 
In conclusion, Δ9-THC is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Oral 
exposure results in lowe r, more delayed peak ∆9-THC concentrations and a lower bioavailability 
compared to other routes. In humans following oral ingestion of 20 mg Δ9-THC, peak Δ9-THC 
concentrations were observed ranging from 4.4 to 11 ng/mL, with oral bioavailability estimated at 
6 %, between 1 to 5 hours after ingestion. Following oral administration of Δ9-THC, plasma levels of 
the inactive metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were higher and measurable for longer compared to 
the parent compound and the active metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC.  Consumption of alcohol prior to  
smoking marijuana may increase absorption of Δ9-THC, although the mechanisms remain unknown.  
7.1.2.  Distribution 
Due to its lipophilic nature, Δ9-THC is highly bound to plasma proteins (97 –99 %) and exhibits 
extensive tissue distribution, rapidly entering highly vascularised tissues  resulting in a quick decrease 
in plasma concentration. The volume of distribution is large. In animals and humans, Δ9-THC and 
other metabolites retaining a certain degree of lipophilicity are accumulated in fat from which they 
may be released (redistribution phase) back to other tissues including the brain, for several days.  
Published data in experimental animals concerning the plasma half-life are affected by the duration of 
monitoring Δ9-THC plasma levels. The few studies in which monitoring was performed for several 
days were carried out using parenteral routes. A long terminal half-life was detected, ranging from 
2 to 3 days in i.v. dosed rabbits (Leuschner et al., 1986), 8 days in dogs after i.v. administration 
(Garrett et al., 1977), and 5 days in rats following an intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment (Kreuz and 
Axelrod, 1973). Such values are consistent with a high degree of binding to plasma proteins (albumins 
and lipoproteins (Klausner et al., 1975), a large volume of distribution, and a prevalent accumulation 
in body fat with a remarkable re-distribution phase (Huestis, 2007). Most of the available distribution 
studies have been performed by the i.v. route. In rats, rabbits, and dogs, Δ9-THC is rapidly taken up 
by lungs, liver, kidney, heart and spleen and, to a lesser extent, brain; in this respect, very limited 
differences in the accumulation of 3H-Δ9-THC among different brain regions were noted between 
tolerant and non tolerant mongrel dogs 30 minutes after the i.v. injection of 0.5 mg/kg b.w. (Martin et 
al., 1977). In studies with mice, i.v. injected with radiolabeled Δ9-THC or the metabolite 11- OH-
Δ9-THC, the metabolite was found to leave the intravascular compartment faster than Δ9-THC. These 
data suggested that the metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC may enter other tissues and possibly the brain more 
readily than Δ9-THC (Perez-Reyes et al., 1976). A very high concentration of radioactivity was 
observed in the corpora lutea, in the placenta and in the mammary glands of mice orally administered 
with a single 14C-Δ9-THC dose of 0.65 mg (Freudenthal et al., 1972).  
In animals and humans, Δ9-THC readily crosses the placenta. Depending on the species, fetal plasma 
concentrations are of the same order of magnitude or lower than the maternal concentrations; in both 
canine and ovine fetal blood and tissues, concentrations were lower than in maternal ones (Lee and 
Chiang, 1985). According to studies performed in late term gestating Rhesus monkeys i.v. treated 
with 0.3 mg Δ9-THC /kg b.w., similar Δ9-THC levels were found in maternal blood 3 hours after 
dosing. At that time, Δ9-THC concentrations around 50 ng/g and 100 ng/g were found in fetal brain 
and liver, respectively, but no measurable amounts of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC could be detected, 
suggesting that this metabolite does not readily cross the placenta and that the fetus does not readily

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 33 metabolise Δ9-THC  at that developmental stage  (Bailey et al., 1987). Pregnant mongrel dogs were 
administered intravenously 0.5 mg 3H-Δ9-THC /kg b.w., and sacrificed 30 minutes after dosing. The 
level of radioactivity measured in the brains of mothers was three fold higher than that quantified in 
the corresponding fetal brain areas (Martin et al., 1977). In pregnant rats, the single ora l exposure of 
dams (15 or 50 mg Δ9-THC per kg b.w. the last day of gestation) resulted in fetal Δ9-THC blood 
levels of one tenth of the maternal ones. By contrast, blood levels higher than those recorded in the 
maternal circulation were measured in fetuses  from dams administered either 15 (12 ± 4 vs 10 ± 
2 ng/m L Δ9-THC ) or 50 mg/kg of Δ9-THC (41 ± 6 vs 19 ± 5 ng/m L Δ9-THC ) once daily during the 
last 2 weeks of gestation (Hutchings et al., 1989), reaching the statistical significance ( p < 0.05) at the 
higher  dose level.   
Accumulation of Δ9-THC and metabolites in fatty tissues was suggested by Goodwin et al (2006 ) to 
account for the significant correlations between body mass index (BMI) and C max values for Δ9-THC 
and 11- OH-Δ9-THC noted in a study with male volunteers (see Section 7.1.1). The authors concluded 
that these positive correlations suggest ed that release of Δ9-THC and metabolites into plasma is 
proportional to the amount which has been deposited in adipose tissues.  
In a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study in male and female volunteers investigating 
the pharmacokinetics of Δ9-THC and CBD (Nadulski et al., 2005), significant differences between 
males and females with regard to area under the curve ( AUC ) and C max for Δ9-THC and 11- OH-
Δ9-THC and CBD (higher in females) and time to peak concentration (T max) (longer in males) were 
reported, with the authors noting that there was no significant correlation between AUC or C max and 
the BMI of the volunteers.  
In conclusion, Δ9-THC is highly bound to plasma proteins (97 –99 %) and exhibits extensive tissue 
distribution, rapidly entering highly vascularised tissues resulting in a quick decrease in plasma 
concentration. Due to its lipophilic nature Δ9-THC may accumulate in the adipose tissue and be 
released back to other tissues including the brain, for several days. Possible gender-related differences 
in Δ9-THC and 11- OH-Δ9-THC kinetics as well as correlations between BMI and Δ9-THC C max have 
been reported. 
7.1.3.  Metabolism 
In rats, ∆9-THCA-A (the precursor of ∆9-THC) undergoes a biotransformation pathway similar to that 
described in humans, with oxidation at C11 followed by glucuronidation (Jung et al., 2009) (see 
below for further details). However, neither ∆9-THC nor its metabolites were present in urine from 
∆9-THCA-A orally treated rats (Jung et al., 2009), pointing to the apparent lack of the in vivo  
conversion of ∆9-THCA-A to Δ9-THC. In the context of a PhD thesis by Wohlfarth (2012), human 
volunteers (six male and ten female) were administered 10 mg Δ9-THCA-A orally, and then 14 days 
later 5 mg Δ9-THCA-A were applied i.v. to the same volunteers. Blood and urine samples were 
collected for up to 96 hours after dosing. The results showed that Δ9-THCA-A was present in almost 
all 96-hour-serum-samples while in urine samples only minimal amounts were found. No sample 
(after per os  (p.o.) and i.v. application) contained substantial Δ9-THC amounts indicating that in vivo  
transformation of Δ9-THCA- A into Δ9-THC did not occur.  
In mammalian species, the main oxidative biotransformation pathways of Δ9-THC occur in the liver 
and are mediated by different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, mainly of the CYP2C (i.e. CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 in humans ) and to a lesser extent, 3A subfamilies (i.e. CYP3A4 in humans ) (Watanabe et 
al., 2007; Health Canada, 2013). In most experimental species, including the monkey, CYP2C 
subfamily is mainly responsible for hepatic Δ9-THC hydroxylation (Yamamoto et al., 2003), which 
i
nvolves the aliphatic oxidation at C11, yielding the psychoactive metabolite 11-OH-Δ9-THC.  
Mi
crosomal ‘aldehyde oxygenase ’ is involved in the further oxidation of the 11- OH-Δ9-THC to 
inactive 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC (Figure 5). The aldehyde oxygenase activity is a common property 
of CYP2C and other CYP isoenzymes purified from rat liver (Yamamoto et al., 1995). The carboxylic

11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC and 1l- OH-Δ9-THC (Huestis, 2007). Extrahepatic oxidation at the side 
chain has also been described giving rise to hydroxylated (active) metabolites in the brain, possibly 
via CYP3A enzymes (Watanabe et al., 2011). Extrahepatic biotransformations resulting in a side 
chain hydroxylation at C4 have been documented in brain microsomes from mice, rats, guinea pigs, 
and rabbits (Watanabe et al., 1988); the most prominent metabolite was the 4'-hydroxylated 
metabolite on the pentyl side chain of the cannabinoids in all species tested, except that the 
5'-hydroxylation of Δ9-THC was most abundant in the guinea pig. In mice the reaction is possibly 
mediated by Cyp 3a (Watanabe et al., 2011). These metabolites are pharmacologically active, but 
their relative activity remains unknown.  
 
 
Figure 5:  Main oxidative biotra nsformation pathways of Δ9-THC in mammalian species 
Qualitative and quantitative differences in the biotransformation of cannabinoids have been reported 
between experimental species (Harvey and Brown, 1991). In the mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and 
gerbil the CYP-mediated hydroxylation at C11 largely predominates, whereas in the cat and the 
hamster the reaction mostly occurs at C4 and C8, respectively. Hydroxylation of the pentyl side chain 
also occurs in all species, but most extensively in the guinea pig. Remarkable sex-related differences 
have been documented in rats. It has been reported that Δ9-THC is almost exclusively metabolised to 
1l-OH-Δ9-THC by hepatic microsomes of female rats, whereas in male rats it was oxidised to 8α - and 
3’-hydroxy- Δ9-THC as well as to 11- OH-Δ9-THC (Narimatsu et al., 1990). Accordingly, the greater 
levels of active 11- OH-Δ9-THC metabolites produced by females contribute to greater behavioural 
effects of THC observed in i.p.-dosed females compared to male rats (Tseng et al., 2004). 
In a study aimed at investigating the pharmacological activity of the main Δ9-THC  metab olite 11 -
OH-Δ9-THC in humans,  Perez -Reyes et al . (1972) administered by i.v infusion, Δ9-THC  or 11 -
OH-Δ9-THC  (tritium labelled 2.5 µC/mg) to 12 male volunteers (non -naïve to marijuana usage ) at the 
rate of 0.2  mg/min (0.92 m L/min) until a desired level of marijuana  ‘high’ had been achieved by each 
subject. Respiration and heart rate were monitored throughout the study. The amount of  Δ9-THC  and 
11-OH-Δ9-THC required to increase the heart rate by 25  % over the initial level and for the desired 
level of marijua na ‘high’ were 3. 10 ± 0.90 mg and 2.27 ± 0.81 mg, for Δ9-THC  and 11 -OH-Δ9-THC, 
respectively, the difference being not statistically significant. The authors concluded that both Δ9-
THC  and 11 -OH-Δ9-THC are equally potent as their pharmacological activity is  not significantly 
different when administered intravenously . 
In humans, oral administration of Δ9-THC results in a higher extent (about three times) of metabolism 
of Δ9-THC to the 11- OH-Δ9-THC active metabolite compared to exposure by smoking (or 
vaporization) (Health Canada, 2013). Following oral Δ9-THC administration, presystemic metabolism 
yields an 11- OH-Δ9-THC/ Δ9-THC ratio of approximately 1 (Goodwin et al., 2006; Huestis, 2007).

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 35 (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) responsible for the oxidation of Δ9-THC. For CYP2C9 only two coding 
v
ariants, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, are common and functionally relevant among Caucasian 
populations. Sachse-Seeboth et al. (2009) studied 43 healthy volunteers to investigate the impact of 
the CYP2C9 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered Δ9-THC. The authors 
found that the pharmacokinetics of Δ9-THC did not differ for individuals with CYP2C9*2 allele 
status. However, for CYP2C9*3/*3 homozygotes compared to CYP2C9*1/*1 homozygotes, the 
median area under the Δ9-THC curve was threefold higher and that of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC was 
70 % lower. CYP2C9*3 carriers also exhibited higher scores for sedation recorded by the Stanford 
sleepiness scale. The authors concluded that the CYP2C9*3 variant may influence both the 
therapeutic and adverse effects of THC. 
According to Fisher et al (2001), about 15 human uridine diphosphate ( UDP )-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) have been identified, with notable expression in liver and 
extrahepatic tissues. UGT1A enzymes, which are highly expressed in both liver and the intestine thus 
affecting the oral bioavailability of several drugs, also display a high number of genetic variants. 
Specific UGTs were investigated by Mazur et al. (2009) in an attempt to further characterise the phase 
II metabolic pathways of Δ9-THC. According to the authors, the active metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC 
was preferentially metabolised by UGT1A9 and recognised by UGT1A10. Further oxidation o f 
11-OH
-Δ9-THC to 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC led to a loss in metabolism by UGT1A9 and 
UGT1A10, while creating a substrate recognised by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3.  
The cannabinoid CBD and substances such as barbiturates, ketoconazole, rifampicin, sulfaphenazole, 
may hinder the oxidative metabolism of Δ9-THC with different mechanisms (Ujváry and 
Grotenhermen, 2014).  
In conclusion, studies in both rats and humans indicate that the in vivo  conversion of ∆9-THCA-A to 
Δ9-THC does not occur. The main oxidative biotransformation pathways occur in the liver and consist 
in the CYP-mediated generation of the psychoactive 11- OH-Δ9-THC, a further oxidation to the 
inactive carboxylic acid derivative 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC and the glucuronidation of the parent 
compound and both metabolites. CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes are primarily involved in Δ9-THC 
metabolism in humans. Polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 enzyme can impact on the kinetics of 
Δ9-THC. Extrahepatic biotransformations resulting in a side chain hydroxylation at C4 have been 
documented in brain microsomes from mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Oral administration of 
Δ9-THC results in a higher extent of metabolism of Δ9-THC to 11- OH-Δ9-THC compared to exposure 
by smoking.  
7.1.4.  Excretion 
Δ9-THC is slowly cleared from plasma mainly because of the re-diffusion from fat and other tissues 
into the blood. In animals and humans, the parent compound and its conjugated metabolites are 
mainly excreted via the faeces (about 2/3 of a single dose) and the urine (about 1/3 of a single dose); a 
remarkable extent of tubular reabsorption and enterohepatic recycling play an important role in the 
slow elimination rate of the drug and of its metabolites (Wang, 1982; McGilveray, 2005; Huestis, 
2007). No major differences in the elimination of Δ9-THC have been described in experimental 
animals compared to humans. (Agurell et al., 1986). 
In human studies, Wall et al. (1983), reported that following oral and i.v. administration of Δ9-THC to 
healthy male and female volunteers both non-conjugated or conjugated acid metabolites were 
excreted in urine (approximately 13 % to 16 % of the total dose following both oral and i.v dosing) 
w
ith 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC being a major metabolite present. Biliary excretion via the faeces 
accounted for approximately 30 % and 50 % of the total dose after i.v. and oral dosing respectively, 
with only non-conjugate metabolites present. Following i.v dosing, both 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-
9-carboxy- Δ9- THC were detected and after oral dosing 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC was the main 
metabolite present.

=== PAGINA 36 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 36 The importance of the biliary route in cannabinoid excretion has been flagged by Fabritius et al. 
(
2012) who determined concentrations of Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC, CBN, 
CBD, THCA-A, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC-glucuronide and Δ9-THC-glucuronide, from human bile 
samples collected at autopsy, from ten cases where bile was available and blood and/or urine 
specimens analysis revealed the presence of significant amounts of cannabinoids. High median 
concentrations of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC-glucuronide (9 655 ng/mL) and Δ9-THC-glucuronide 
(78 ng/mL) were detected. The median concentrations of the other analytes were lower (between 
3.4 and 23 ng/mL) and THCA-A was not detected.  
Although the high lipophilicity of Δ9-THC is expected to result in the transfer of measurable amounts 
of the cannabinoid and possibly of its metabolites into breast milk, very few studies have been 
conducted in experimental and farm animals (Jakubovic et al., 1974), mostly involving parenteral 
exposure routes. The only available study addressing the quantitative transfer of orally administered 
Δ9-THC was performed in 11 mother squirrel monkeys and in their 3-to 6-month old infants (Chao et 
al., 1976). Lactating monkeys, receiving 2 mg Δ9-THC /kg b.w. either two or five times weekly for 
20 weeks, were administered a tracer dose of 14C-Δ9-THC allowing a radioquantitation of the 
cannabinoid in milk collected 1 and 24 hours after the administration of the labelled dose. 
Approximately 0.2 % of the labelled Δ9-THC was excreted in the milk. 
In 1982 Perez-Reyes and Wall suggested that Δ9-THC is concentrated in and secreted into human 
breast milk. An 8-fold difference was noted between concentrations of Δ9-THC in milk compared to 
maternal plasma levels. This accumulation in milk was not noted for OH- Δ9-THC to 11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC, indicating that the metabolites are less lipophilic than Δ9-THC. The authors 
suggested that Δ9-THC present in human milk is absorbed and metabolised by the nursing infant, as 
the levels of OH- Δ9-THC compared to 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were higher in infant faecal 
samples compar ed to the mother’s milk. Based on these findings Bennett (1997) calculated that 0.8  % 
of the weight-adjusted maternal intake of one marijuana cigarette would be ingested by an infant in 
one feeding. 
In conclusion, Δ9-THC and its metabolites are slowly excreted via the faeces mainly, and also in 
urine. Milk excretion of Δ9-THC and its metabolites has been documented in humans and in a number 
of laboratory and farm animals (see Section 7.1.6.1). 
7.1.5.  Other cannabinoids 
Besides more than 60 compounds, CBN and CBD are further main hemp components (Lachenmeier 
and Walch, 2005). While CBD is not psychoactive but may exert several pharmacological actions, 
CBN is thought to exert minimal effects on the CNS . The pharmacokinetics and biotransformation 
pathways of CBD and CBN in humans and animals are similar to those of Δ9-THC (Agurell, 1986). 
Inhibitory effects on a wide array of human and rodent CYPs, as well as on human multidrug 
resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) have been reported for both compounds (Stout and Cimino, 2014) 
with the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (Benowitz et al., 1980; Nadulski et al., 
2005). 
7.1.6.  Farm animals 
Hemp is considered a valuable source of several nutrients for livestock species. As recently reviewed 
by EFSA (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011), several studies have been published mainly involving the 
administration of hemp seed derivatives to a number of food producing species, including cattle, 
laying hens, and fish. Although the lipophilicity of cannabinoids and their kinetic behaviour in 
humans and in experimental animals has been clearly assessed, none of these studies addressed the 
issue of the transfer of the parent compound and possibly some of its metabolites to edible tissues and 
animal products (milk, eggs). In addition, there is scant information on Δ9-THC kinetics in farm 
animals, and the only available reports are concerned with milk excretion in ruminants and plasma 
kinetics and tissue distribution in pigs.

=== PAGINA 37 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 37 7.1.6.1.  Ruminants 
Lactating ewes were i.v. administered once with 0.02 or 1 mg/kg b.w. of [14C] Δ9-THC and urine, 
faeces, and milk were collected at 4, 8, 24, 48 and 96 hours. Radioactivity pertaining to the parent 
compound and to unidentified metabolites could be found in milk samplings from all tested time 
points as well as in the faeces and urine of a suckling lamb. Only 15 % of the total radioactivity was 
excreted by treated ewes in the first 48 hours, confirming the slow elimination of the cannabinoid 
observed in other species (Jakubovic et al., 1974). 
In a preliminary experiment performed at the Swiss Center for Agriculture, a single oral dose of 
625 mg Δ9-THC. was administered to one lactating cow. Blood sampling was performed every 2 to 
6 hours for the first 48 hours after dosing and then after 2 weeks, while milk samples were collected 
twice a day for 2 weeks. Both the parent compound and its main hydroxylated metabolite (11- OH-
Δ9-THC) were determined by a GC-MS method after previous hydrolysis of the samples (LOD 
0.2 µg/L, LOQ 0.2-0.5 µg/L). Peak Δ9-THC levels of 5 µg/L and 20 µg/L were detected after 10 –
12 hours and 23 hours in plasma and milk, respectively, while the corresponding figures for 11- OH-
Δ9-THC were 1 and < 0.3 µg/L. A calculated milk half-life of 29 hours was reported (Guidon and 
Zoller, 1999). In a further unpublished study described in EFSA’s previous assessment (EFSA 
FEEDAP Panel, 2011) describing a field case, 80 cows were fed for 6 consecutive days 0.5 kg/day 
pellets prepared from the whole hemp plant with a calculated daily dose of 3 250 mg total THC (GC-
MS analysis). The Δ9-THC content of bulk milk collected on days 4 and 5 amounted to 0.241 mg/L, 
while that of bulk milk collected on day 6 was 0.233 mg/L, indicating that a steady-state was reached 
after 4 to 5 days of hemp administration.  
In northern Pakistan, C. sativa  grows spontaneously among other natural vegetation and is normally 
ingested by buffalo, the common dairy animals in that region. A study was therefore conducted to 
evaluate the transfer of Δ9-THC to milk and the eventual transfer to humans consuming the 
contaminated milk. The exposure to Δ9-THC was assessed by measuring the metabolite 11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC in buffalo milk and urine and in human urine with a GC-MS method using 
deuterated Δ9-THC as an internal standard (LOD 5 ng/mL). Six out of 10 buffalo urine samples and 
five out of 10 buffalo milk samples were found to contain 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC in the range of 
17–289 µg/L and 32 –173 µg/L, respectively. Interestingly, measurable amounts of 11-nor-9-carboxy-
Δ9-THC were detected in two out of seven urine specimens from children (3 to 6 years old) 
consuming the contaminated milk (Ahmad and Ahmad, 1990). Data on the Δ9-THC content of the 
ingested forage were not provided. 
There are no data available on in vivo  transformation of Δ9-THCA- A into Δ9-THC for ruminants, 
which are known to decarboxylate a number of plant phenolic compounds in the rumen (Martin, 
1982). 
In conclusion, the transfer to milk of Δ9-THC and two of its metabolites has been documented in both 
experimentally treated and naturally exposed dairy ruminants. No other information is available on 
tissue distribution and the profile displayed by Δ9-THC and its metabolites in edible tissues. No data 
are available for ruminants on the in vivo  transformation of Δ9-THCA- A into Δ9-THC. 
7.1.6.2.  Pig
s 
A study was designed to validate the pig as an animal model for studying the kinetics of cannabinoids 
(Brunet et al., 2006). A total of seven Large White pigs (weight range 29 –44 kg) were i.v. injecte d 
with 50 (n = 2), 100 (n = 3), or 200 µg Δ9-THC/kg b.w., corresponding to a range between 1.5 and 
8.8 mg THC/animal. Blood samples were collected up to 48 hours after dosing and a GC-MS method 
with deuterated internal standards was used for plasma Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC, and 11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC determination. As expected, both C max (range between 39.5 and 161 ng/mL) and 
AUC values (range between 799 and 8 074 ng/mL/min) were dose-related. The quite long terminal 
half-life (10.6 ± 2.2 hours) and the large distribution volume ( Vd) (32 ± 14.6 L/kg) are consistent with 
the high lipophilicity of the drug and a noteworthy tissue storage. The measured concentrations of

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 38 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC were much lower (0.5-4 ng/mL). Tissue distribution was studied in a 
further experiment involving eight individuals administered with 200 µg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. by the i.v. 
route. Two pigs were slaughtered 30 minutes, and 2, 6, 24 hours after dosing, respectively, and the 
parent compound as well the mentioned metabolites were determined in several tissues. By expressing 
the Δ9-THC concentration at 30 minutes as 100 %, only fat (34 %) and lung (2.5 %) exhibited 
measurable amounts of the drug 24 hours after the injection. Residues of the drug could also be found 
in brain (9 %), spleen, heart, and kidney (approximately 2 % for each tissue) six hours post-dosing, 
while in muscle (25.6 %) and liver (2.7 %) they could be detected only two hours after dosing. The 
psychoactive metabolite (11- OH-Δ9-THC) could be found only in liver samples collected 30 minutes 
and two hours following Δ9-THC administration, respectively, whereas the inactive one (11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC) could not be quantified in any of the collected tissues. In a more recent report 
performed by the same research group (Brunet et al., 2010) and aimed at studying the post mortem  
redistribution of Δ9-THC in the pig for forensic purposes, 15 Large White pigs (weight range 29 –
50 kg) were treated i.v. with 200 µg THC/kg b.w. and sacrificed 2 hours later. At that time, tissue 
accumulation of Δ9-THC (mean ± SD, rounded figures) was in the following order (ng/g): lung (476 ± 
212) > fat (44 ± 12) > kidney (43 ± 30) > brain (15 ± 4) > muscle (14 ± 7) > liver (3 ± 5). 
In conclusion, even if obtained with a single dosing using a parenteral route, and thus of very limited 
utility for rate of transfer determination, data from the above studies confirm that fat may accumulate 
Δ9-THC and retain it for a longer time compared with other edible tissues (muscle, liver). 
7.2. Transfer from feed to food of animal origin  
A very limited number of studies are available to calculate the transfer rate of Δ9-THC and its 
precursor/metabolites into  food of animal origin (see Section 7.1.6); milk is the only matrix for which 
a transfer rate could be estimated. 
In the study performed in northern Pakistan and involving dairy buffalo spontaneously ingesting 
C. sativa  as a part of their diet (Ahmad and Ahmad, 1990), the presence of the marker metabolite 11-
nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC was confirmed in six out of 10 examined milk samples (range 32-173 µg/L). 
The occurrence of the same metabolite in two out of seven urine specimens of 3- to 6 year-old 
children consuming the contaminated milk was taken as an indirect proof of the excretion of Δ9-THC 
in buffalo milk. As neither the amount of the ingested Δ9-THC nor its concentration in milk were 
reported, data from this study can not be used for the assessment of transfer from feed to food of 
animal origin. 
The only experiment performed in dairy cows under controlled conditions has been briefly reported 
by Guidon and Zoller (1999); some figures related to this experiment have been made available to 
EFSA by the Swiss authorities. One cow was administered a total of 625 mg THC (divided into two 
gelatine capsules) by gavage; milk was collected twice a day for the following 14 days and the 
concentrations of both Δ9-THC and its hydroxylated metabolite 11- OH-Δ9- THC were determined with 
a 
GC-MS method (LOD 0.2 µg/L, LOQ 0.3-0.5 µg/L). The concentration of Δ9-THC peaked at 
23 hours (16.7 µg/L) and values higher than LOD could be detected up to 8 days after dosing. The 
calculated cumulated transfer rate of Δ9-THC into milk was about 0.1 % based on a daily milk yield 
of about 15 L, and a half-life of about 30 hours for the elimination from milk was estimated. 
Negli gible amounts of 11-OH-Δ9-THC (< 0.3 µg/L) could be found (no numerical data available). 
Further unpublished data on THC transfer rate into milk were made available to EFSA by the Swiss 
authorities and described in EFSA’s previous assessment (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2011). Hemp pellets 
prepared from the whole hemp plant containing very high amounts of total THC were accidentally fed 
to 80 dairy cows for 6 consecutive days, with a calculated daily ingestion of 3 250 mg total 
T
HC/head/day. At the calculated steady-state (about 4 to 5 days of hemp administration), bulk milk

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 39 values of 0.237 mg /L Δ9-THC were measured20 and an extrapolated daily transfer rate of ~ 0.15 % 
could be calculated.  
In conclusion, based on a very limited dataset, Δ9-THC excretion in milk has been indirectly 
demonstrated in buffalo and assessed in dairy cows. Negligible amounts of 11- OH-Δ9-THC have been 
reported in one cow study, while the presence of the glucuronide derivative (11-nor-9-carboxy-
Δ9-THC) has been reported in buffalo milk. No data related to the milk excretion of the Δ9-THC 
precursor acid Δ9-THCA-A could be found. Transfer rates of Δ9-THC in dairy milk in the range 0.1 –
0.15 % were calculated. Based on both the relatively high lipophilicity of Δ9-THC and some of its 
metabolites (e.g. 11- OH-Δ9-THC), and the studies on Δ9-THC distribution in i.v. dosed pigs (Brunet 
et al., 2006, 2010), the presence of residues of such chemicals in fat and in other edible tissues or 
animal products (e.g. eggs) from food-producing species fed with hemp products can not be excluded. 
However, no appropriate studies could be found to derive a transfer rate. 
7.3. Modes of action  
7.3.1.  Interaction with cannabinoid receptors 
The biological effects of Δ9-THC are mediated by binding to specific G-protein coupled receptors 
(cannabinoid receptors, CB 1 and CB 2), which have been identified in all mammalian species tested. 
Research has shown that Δ9-THC, as a partial agonist, resembles the endogenous ligand anandamide 
(N-arachidonoylethanolamine) in its CB 1 affinity, albeit with less efficacy than anandamide, whilst 
displaying even lower efficacy at CB 2 receptors than at CB 1 receptors in vitro (Pertwee, 2008). The 
CB 1 are distributed mainly in the brain (basal ganglia, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebellum, 
but not in the brainstem) spinal cord, heart (sympathetic nerve terminals of superior cervical 
ganglion), immune system and reproductive organs, while CB 2 are mainly distributed in the lymphoid 
organs and immune system. In the CNS, the CB 2 are present on microglia (resident cells in the brain 
parenchyma that pertain to the immune system) (Mechoulam and Parker, 2013; Lutz, 2002). The CB 1 
are expressed from very early stages of development (embryonal), and the receptor density is 
increasing at the transition from adolescence to adulthood.  
The high densities of CB 1 in the prenatal neural structures points to the involvement of the 
cannabinoid system in neural development (Mato et al., 2003).  
CB 1 receptors appears to mediate the Δ9-THC effects on heart rate in humans (Klumpers et al,. 2012).  
Δ9-THC affects the immune system through both CB 1- and CB 2-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms.  Receptors for Δ9-THC are found on immune cells;  with CB 2 expressi on greater than CB 1 
(Srivastava et al., 1998; Karmaus et al., 2013).  
Both CB 1 and CB 2 cannabinoid receptors are expressed in normal human placenta (as well as in 
placental choriocarcinoma cells). Cannabinoids seem to interact with their receptors in the cell 
membrane, reduce intracellular calcium levels, and consequently inhibit the catalytic function of the 
serotonin (5HT) transporter possibly through changes in protein phosphorylation (Ganapathy et al., 
1999). Cannabinoids also interfere with placental amino acid transport. Treatment of human placental 
slices with Δ9-THC, induces a significant inhibition of the uptake of a -aminoisobutyric acid and 
valine (Fisher et al., 1987). 
The effects of marijuana and its active component Δ9-THC on the endocrine system have been 
reviewed in animal models and in humans (Brown and Dobs, 2002). Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids 
may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis mainly via the interaction with CB 1 receptor found 
in the hypothalamus, which directly or indirectly modulates anterior pituitary function, resulting in a 
depression of the reproductive hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone in exposed individuals, 
                                                 
20  The accuracy of this value is questionable due to extraction problems during the analytical determination.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 40 while the effects on thyroid function are controversial. Inconsistent results were obtained in studies 
performed in humans, mainly due to differences in study design, hormonal status in women, and the 
development of tolerance. 
The endogenous ligands, referred to as ‘endocannabinoids ’, are arachidonic acid derivatives and have 
different affinities for CB 1 and CB 2. The endocannabinoids are used for retrograde transmission, i.e. 
they are produced and released from the membrane of the postsynaptic cell and activate CB 1 on the 
axonal terminal (presynaptic cell) to temporarily reduce the amount of conventional neurotransmitters 
(Gamma-Amino Butyric acid (GABA) or glutamate) to be released.  
CB 1 and C B2 receptors are encoded by the cannabinoid receptor genes CNR1  and CNR2 , that have 
been mapped to human chromosome 6 and 1, respectively. Many different human CNR  gene 
polymorphisms have been reported (Onaivi , 2009). The polymorphic sequences are either SNPs or 
larger changes in the number of repeats. Several of these genetic polymorphisms have been linked 
with pathological conditions such as substance abuse and mental di sorders, including schizophrenia, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD ), depression and anxiety. 
CNR  gene polymorphisms may be associated with the diverse actions of marijuana, and play a critical 
role in use and de pendence. There is evidence for a strong association between cannabis use and 
increased risk of psychosis (Martinotti et al. , 2012). However, most cannabis users do not develop 
psychosis suggesting that the genetic background may be critical for individual  vulnerability  (see 
Section 7.1.3) . Among the factors that may influence the individual response to Δ9-THC are CB 1 
cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1 ) variants. CNR1 variants have been associated with both 
substance use disorders (SUD ) phenotypes generally ( Schmidt et al., 2002; Ballon et al ., 2006; 
Herman et al ., 2006; Zuo et al. , 2007, 2009) in human dr ug consumers. For example, it has been 
reported that one variant, a G to A SNP in the third exon, can result in an alternative CNR1  transcript 
in the brain, which seems to be associated with general liability to substance abuse (Zhang et al., 
2004). Howeve r, other studies reported non significant data for this gene (Covault et al ., 2001; 
Hartman et al ., 2009).  
Another critical gene in the endocannabinoid system, which appears to influence cannabis 
dependence, is fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). A missense SNP, C385A (rs324420), results in a 
mutant form of FAAH with reduced expression and cellular stability (Chiang et al., 2004) and it has 
been shown that in marijuana users, the C allele of this SNP is associated with a higher risk for 
progression to cannabis dependence (Tyndale et al., 2007). Also Haughey et al. (2008) reported an 
association between the C allele and craving after marijuana abstinence in young marijuana users. In 
marijuana daily user young adults, the C allele has also been linked to increased severity of 
withdrawal symptoms after abstinence, and increased happiness after smoking (Schacht et al., 2009).   
CNR1, CNR2 as well as FAAH are genes of possible pharmacokinetic relevance (Dasgupta and 
Langman, 2012).  
Also the Val-Val genotype of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met gene 
polymorphism, resulting in a reduced enzymatic activity and reduced degradation of dopamine (DA) 
in the frontal lobe, predisposes cannabis users to a greater risk of developing psychosis (Pelayo-
Terran et al., 2010; Zammit et al., 2010; Estrada et al., 2011). Therefore, in the presence of genetic 
vulnerability, cannabis may predispose to psychosis by influencing the DA sy stem that is known to 
have a key role in the development of psychosis.  
Δ9-THC induces cytotoxicity in various types of cells via cannabinoid receptors. CB 1 receptor-
mediated cell death occurs in hippocampal and cortical neurons (Chan et al., 1998; Downer et al., 
2003), whereas CB 2 receptor-mediated apoptosis occurs in spleno-cytes and leukemia cells (McKallip 
et al., 2002; Herrera et al., 2005). It has been proposed that Δ9-THC neurotoxicity in hippocampal 
neurons is due to activation of G i/o-protein-independent prostanoid synthesis pathway with subsequent 
generation of free radicals (Chan et al., 1998). In cortical neurons, Δ9-THC-induced neurotoxicity 
mediates G i/o-prote in-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Downer et al., 2003).

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 41 Δ9-THC (from 5 microM) activates JNK (stress-activated protein) and caspase-3 (pro-apoptotic 
protease) in neonatal rat cortex in vitro  (brain slices maintained in vitro  as tissue cultures), but not in 
cortical slice preparations obtained from adult rats (Downer et al., 2007). The induction of apoptosis 
(activation of caspase-3, cathepsin-D, and DNA fragmentation) was confirmed in vivo  after acute 
subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of 1 or 30 mg/kg Δ9-THC in newborn, but not in adult rats. This 
study indicates that the developing brain is more sensitive to Δ9-THC, and doses that do not induce 
significant effects in adult animals induce neuronal apoptosis within hours from exposure in the 
developing brain (Downer et al., 2007). In the study of Hansen et al. (2008), the acute administration 
of 10 mg/kg Δ9-THC did not induce neurodegeneration (as measured by DNA fragmentation detected 
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in rat pups aged 
2 to 14 days. However, the co-administration of ethanol (2.2 g/kg) increased the density of 
degenerating cells in an age-related manner, with a peak of the effect at postnatal day (PND ) 7. 
Therefore, the age selected for further tests was PND7. The dose range tested at PND7 was 2 –
40 mg/kg Δ9-THC (2, 20, 20, 40 mg/kg) given in two consecutive s.c. administrations, and none of the 
conc
entrations yielded significant effects. Similarly, 3 g/kg ethanol alone did not induce apoptosis in 
the rat pup brain. However, when the Δ9-THC (2, 10, 20 mg/kg) and ethanol (3 g/kg) were 
administered together, the number of degenerating cells increased in a dose-dependent manner 
(Hansen et al., 2008). 
In human Jurkat leukemia cells, Δ9-THC induces apoptosis by inhibiting the 
MAPK/MEK/ERK/RSK21 pathway via a CB 1/2-mediated mechanism (Jia et al., 2006). 
In leukemia cells, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has a key role in 
Δ9-THC-induced cell death (Herrera et al., 2005). It has been previously reported that Δ9-THC 
induces cell death in macrophages through an alteration of Bcl-2 and caspase-1 activity (Zhu et al., 
1998). 
Δ9-THC induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells that could be rescued by pharmacological 
blockade of the CB 1, but not CB 2, receptors. Δ9-THC caused CB 1-mediated inhibition of both RAS-
MAPK/ERK and PI3K-AKT22 survival signalling cascades, which are cell survival pathways often 
altered in colorectal tumours. (Greenhough et al., 2007). 
7.3.2.  Other modes of action 
A possibility that should also be considered is that Δ9-THC may affect the regulation of histone 
proteins and DNA methylation in specific neuronal subtypes. Such a mechanism may be behind the 
effects reported by Hoffman et al. (2007) showing that following repeated exposure to Δ9-THC, 
hippocampal long-term potentiation was impaired for 14 days. Similarly, a single exposure to Δ9-THC 
induced a 3-day impairment in long-term depression in cortico-accumbens synapses (Henquet et al., 
2008).  
Several neurotransmitter systems have been shown to be affected by Δ9-THC exposure in 
experimental models. Thus, acute exposure to Δ9-THC induces a dose-dependent increase in 5HT, 
noradrenaline (NE) and DA (Abdel-Salam et al., 2013). In addition, it increases the density of DA 
receptors in the midbrain and basal ganglia after subchronic exposure to 1 mg/kg per day (3 days, i.p.) 
in juvenile male rats, and decreases the behavioural activation in response to acute amfetamine 
administration (Ginovart et al., 2012).  
Short term administration of 1 mg/kg/day i.p. Δ9-THC in adult male rats has been reported to exert 
antidepressant effects by modulating the 5HT release from the raphe nucleus and increasing tonic 
activity of hippocampal 5HT receptors (Bambico et al., 2012). In contrast, chronic administration of

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 42 10 mg/kg/day i.p. in young adult mice reduced the binding of 5HT in the cingulate cortex, anterior 
insula, and ventral pallidum (part of the basal ganglia), but increased 5HT binding in caudo-putamen 
(part of the basal ganglia) (Long et al., 2013). Developmental exposure to 5 mg/kg/day Δ9-THC p.o. 
(
gestational day ( GD) 5-PND1) in rats decreases the concentration of 5HT only in the diencephalon 
ar
ound the time of delivery (Molina-Holgado et al., 1996). The same authors report in a later study 
that the exposure to Δ9-THC from GD5 until weaning had persistent effects that involved several 
brain regions in adult male rats (Molina-Holgado et al., 1997). 
It has been shown that Δ9-THC inhibits, in a non- competitive manner, the binding of µ and δ  but not 
k-opioid receptor ligands to rat brain membranes (Vaysse et al., 1987). A 5-day treatment with 
Δ9-THC 5 mg/kg/day, i.p. increased 38 %. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) messenger RNA (mRNA) 
levels in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, but had no effects in the anterior pituitary 
(Corchero et al., 1997). Acute administration of Δ9-THC appears to exert antioxidant effects. Thus, 
chronic administration of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day in young adult male mice dose-dependently 
decreased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production, and increased the concentration of reduced 
glutathione (GSH) (Abdel-Salam et al., 2013). 
In conclusion, the major effects of Δ9-THC can be explained on the basis of the function of the 
cannabinoid receptor system - CB 1 mainly found in the brain and CB 2 distributed in lymphoid organs 
and the immune system. The presence of specific polymorphisms may affect the response to Δ9-THC  
and cause a genetic vulnerability. Exposure to Δ9-THC may induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in 
various cell types via the cannabinoid receptors.  Δ9-THC may affect the regulation of histone proteins 
and DNA methylation in specific neuronal subtypes . Anti-oxidant effects of Δ9-THC have also been 
observed following acute exposure. Exposure to Δ9-THC has also been shown to affect 
neurotransmitter systems . 
7.4. Toxicity in experimental animals 
7.4.1.  Acute toxicity 
Single doses of Δ9-THC administered orally to dogs, from 66 to 3 000 mg  Δ9- THC/kg and to 
monkeys, from 131 to 9 000 mg  Δ9-THC/kg, were not found to be lethal (Thompson et al., 1973a).  
In dogs, clinical observations consisted of mydriasis and salivation, emesis, vocalisation and anorexia 
(18–24 hours post dose), and behavioural changes which included convulsions, inactivity, prostration, 
drowsiness and lack of coordination. One dog given 3 000 mg  Δ9-THC/kg was examined 
histologically and no microscopic findings were noted. 
In monkeys, initially after treatment some animals showed hyperactivity, hyperreactivity and 
aggressive behaviours. Thereafter clinical observations consisting of emesis, anorexia and 
hypothermia and behavioural changes which consisted of inactivity, lethargy, lack of coordination, 
imbalance and huddled posture were noted. At the higher doses (6 000, 7 000 and 9 000 mg  
Δ9-
THC/kg) the onset of the behavioural changes was more rapid and the duration was longer 
compared to the lower doses. There were no macroscopic findings noted at necropsy in monkeys 
given the higher doses. One monkey given 1 050 mg  Δ9-THC/kg was examined histologically and no 
microscopic findings were noted. 
Acute toxicity of Δ9-THC was determined in rats and mice and the LD 50 values are summarised in 
Table 8.

Philips et al. (1971), noted that deaths, for both rats and mice, occurred between 10 and 36 hours post 
dose, following intraperitoneal (i.p). and oral (gavage) dosing and within 15 minutes following i.v. 
dosing. Clinical observations preceding death noted for both species, for all three dose routes, 
included hyperexcitability, ataxia, loss of righting reflex, depression and dyspnea progressing to 
apnea. In addition, tremor, diarrhoea and lacrimation were noted in rats and diarrhoea noted in mice, 
f
ollowing i.p. and oral dosing, and straub tail was observed in mice following i.v. dosing. 
In the study by Thompson et al. (1973a) single doses of Δ9-THC were administered to Wistar-Lewis 
and Fischer rats. Deaths occurred within 36 to 72 hours after dosing and were attributed to 
hypothermia and other central effects. Clinical observations included frequent urination, lacrimation 
and dose-related weight loss, bradypnea and behavioural changes consisting inactivity, prostration, 
wide stance, muscle tremors and ataxia, were observed. 
In conclusion, acute exposure to Δ9- THC of doses up to 3 000 and 9 000 mg/kg in dogs and monkeys, 
r
espectively, were not found to be lethal. The LD 50 for rats and mice following acute oral exposure to  
Δ9-THC was noted at 666 mg/kg and 482 mg  Δ9-THC/kg, respectively.  
7.4.2.  Repeated dose toxicity 
The toxicity of Δ9-THC was assessed under the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) in F344/N 
rats and B6C3F1 mice, following oral administration 5 days each week, for 13 weeks, for 13 weeks 
with a 9-week recovery period and for 2 years (see also Section 7.4.7 for neoplastic results from the 
2-year studies) (NTP, 1996 ). In the 13-week studies and 13-week studies with 9-weeks of recovery, 
10 male and 10 female animals of each species were dosed at 0, 5, 15, 50, 150 or 500 mg/kg b.w. per 
day with Δ9-THC (97 % purity) in corn oil.  
I
n rats, during the 13 week dosing period, deaths were noted in both studies, consisting of one female 
at 15 mg/kg b.w. per day, three males at both 50 mg/kg b.w. per day and 150 mg/kg b.w. per day and 
10 males and 11 females at 500 mg/kg b.w. per day, although mortality was considered attributable to 
treatment with Δ9-THC only at 500 mg/kg b.w. per day. No deaths were noted during the recovery 
period. Group mean body weight and body weight gain at the end of the 13-week treatment period 
were significantly lower for both sexes at ≥  15 mg/kg b.w. per day, compared to the control. These 
decreases were dose-dependant in males. At the end of the recovery period group mean body weight 
was similar to the control for all treated groups. Food consumption was comparable to the control in 
both rat studies except for decreases noted during the first week of dosing for all treated groups in the 
13-week study, with no recovery period and for females dosed at 500 mg/kg b.w.per day in the 
13-week study with recovery period. Clinical observations included aggressiveness in both sexes and 
in particular for rats dosed at ≥  150 mg/kg b.w.per day, lethargy, sensitivity to touch, diarrhoea, 
tremors and convulsions (during handling) were observed. During the recovery period convulsions,

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 44 sensitivity to touch and aggressiveness were still apparent. Following 13 weeks of dosing, increases in 
relative organ weight at ≥  15 mg/kg b.w. per day for brain, heart and right kidney and right testis 
weights, and for liver weights at 150 or 500 mg/kg b.w. per day in males were observed and were 
attributed to the lower mean body weights noted for these dose groups. Increases in male relative liver 
weight were still apparent at the end of the recovery period at 150 and 500 mg/kg b.w. per day. 
Effects in male and female reproductive organs were observed. In males, epididymal weight was 
significantly decreased at 500 mg/kg b.w. per day and an increase in abnormal sperm was also noted 
at
 this dose. A dose-related decreasing trend in sperm motility was also observed. In females absolute 
and relative uterus weight s were lower at ≥  50 mg/kg b.w. per day, and a dose related increase in the 
length of oestrus cycle was observed, achieving statistical significance at ≥  15 mg/kg b.w. per day. 
T
reatment-related histopathological findings were noted at ≥  150 mg/kg b.w. per day and consisted of 
at
rophy of the testes and uterine and ovarian hypoplasia. At the end of the recovery period atrophy of 
the testes was still noted at 500 mg/kg b.w. per day and absolute right testis weight was lower 
com
pared to the control. 
In the 2-y ear rat study doses of 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg b.w. per day with Δ9-THC in corn oil were 
administered to male and female rats. Compared to the control groups, mean body weight was lower 
for male and female rats throughout the study, although by the end of the 2 years mean body weight 
was only slightly lower compared to the control for both sexes. There were no difference in food 
consumption in the treated groups compared to the control, although lower food consumption was 
noted for females in the control group. Convulsions were noted for all groups treat with Δ9-THC, with 
an earlier onset noted for the higher doses and for females. At a 15-month interim evaluation total 
leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were increased and platelet counts were lower in all female dose 
groups compared to the control. Significant increases in relative brain and liver weights, were 
observed for males and females at all doses compared to the control, although dose –related only for 
male liver weight. Increases in relative adrenal gland weight were also noted for females at all doses , 
although these increases were not stati stically significant or dose-related. The increases in relative 
organ weight is considered to be attributed to the lower mean body weights observed throughout the 
study. Decreases in relative thymus weights were noted for females during this 15-month interim 
evaluation. Changes were observed in serum hormone levels monitored at the 15-month interim 
analysis in male rats. Namely, dose-related statistically significant increases were observed for follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) and lutenising hormone (LH) at ≥ 12.5 mg/kg  b.w. per day.  
In mice, some deaths occurred in both studies in all groups (including control); however, they were 
not considered attributable to treatment with Δ9-THC. Group mean body weight and body weight gain 
at the end of the 13-week treatment period were significantly lower for males at 500 mg/kg b.w.per 
day, compared to the control. At the end of the recovery period body weights were similar to the 
control for all dose groups. For all treated groups, food consumption during the 13-week dosing 
period was similar to the control, and slightly greater, although not significant, during the recovery 
period. Clinical observations were noted during the dosing period and persisted during the recovery 
period, consisting of lethargic, aggressive and easily startled behaviours and brief convulsions. 
Relative liver weights were increased significantly at the end of the 13-week dosing period in both 
sexes at 500 mg/kg b.w. per day compared to the control, and oestrous cycle lengths were longer 
≥ 5 mg/kg b.w. per day (statistically significant at 5, 15 and 500 mg/kg b.w. per day). At the end of 
t
he recovery period, compared to the controls, sperm concentration of males dosed at 500 mg/kg b.w. 
per
 day was significantly lower and absolute uterine weights at ≥ 50 mg/kg b.w. per day and relative 
uterine weights ≥  150 mg/kg b.w. per day, were lower. 
In the 2-year study, doses of 0, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg b.w.per day with Δ9-THC in corn oil were 
administered to male and female mice. Mean body weight was lower for male and female mice 
compared to the control throughout the study. Feed consumption was however similar to the controls. 
H
yperactivity and convulsions were noted for all treated groups, with convulsions which were seen to 
commence earlier at the higher doses. At a 15-month interim evaluation total leukocyte and 
lymphocyte counts were increased and platelet counts were lower in all male dose groups compared to

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 45 the control. Increased incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia were noted in male and 
female mice, and in male mice only increased incidences of hyperplasia and ulcers of the forestomach 
were seen. 
In a study by Thompson et al. (1973b), rats dosed orally with Δ9-THC for 119 days at 50, 250, 400 or 
500 mg/kg b.w. per day. Dose-related mortality was noted from 400 mg/kg in both sexes, with a 
higher incidence in females. Clinical observations included inactivity, wide stance, hypothermia, 
bradypnea and slow movements. Hyperactivity was apparent with an earlier onset for animals treated 
at the lower doses. Convulsions, dose-related in initial onset were noted. Urinary excretion vo lumes 
were increased for all treated rats. Dose-related changes in organ weights were noted for prostate, 
uterus, ovary and spleen and adrenals. Histopathological findings were noted in the bone marrow, 
spleen, adrenal and testes. 
In conclusion, in repeated dose oral toxicity studies in rats and mice, findings included mortality 
attributable to treatment at the high dose, decreases in body weight, clinical observations, decreases in 
epididymal weights and sperm motility and increases in abnormal sperm, lower uterus weight, 
increase in oestrus cycle length. Histopathological findings included atrophy of the testes and ovarian 
and uterine hypoplasia in rats and hyperplasia of thyroid gland follicular cells and of the forestomach 
in mice.  
7.4.3.  Immunotoxicity 
Cannabinoids are reported to cause immunomodulating effects ( Kimber and Selgrade, 1998; 
LeCapitaine et al, 2011 ).  
Subcutaneous administration of Δ9-THC to mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w., given either once, or 
dai
ly for 7 or 14 days, induced changes in functional and/or biochemical immune parameters. One 
hour after a single dose, a significant decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2) production was noted and 
interferon gamma (IFN- λ) was reduced. Following 7 days of treatment functional para meters 
(splenocyte proliferation and natural killer cell (NK) activity) were strongly inhibited and a persistent 
reduction in IL-2 and IFN- λ was noted. After 14 days of treatment, splenocyte proliferation and NK 
activity were significantly reduced, IL-2 levels were similar to the control and IFN- λ was still 
decreased. After 14 days there was a 20 % reduction in the number of T lymphocytes. The authors 
concluded that in vivo  exposure to psychoacti ve doses of Δ9-THC had profound effects on immune 
function (Massi et al., 1998).  
D
o et al. (2004) demonstrated that Δ9-THC  at concentrations of 5 μM or greater induced apoptosis in 
bone marrow derived dendritic cells (bmDC)  from C57BL/6 mice that were cult ured in serum -free 
medium, through the engagement of both CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. It was shown that treatment with 
Δ9-THC  led to changes such as activation of caspases 2, 8, and 9, cleavage of Bid (a Bcl2 -family 
protein), cytochrome C release, a decrease in  mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in 
phosphorylation of I κβ-α. This study also demonstrated the in vivo  effects in mice of Δ9-THC  
administration, and showed that there was a decrease in the number of splenic dentri tic cells ( DCs), 
and in t he expression of  major histocompatibility complex class II  (MHC II ) on DCs.  
Δ9-THC also induced apoptosis in naïve macrophages as well as in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-
activated macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity of Balb/c mice (Zhu et al., 1998) . At a 
concentration of 5 μg/mL DNA fragmentation occurred and at 10 μg/mL significant DNA 
fragmentation and membrane damage after 24 h ours of treatment  was observed .  
Karmaus et al. (2013) investigated the modulation of the inflammatory immune response to influenza 
by Δ9-THC  and the role of CB 1 and/or CB 2 as receptor targets for Δ9-THC . C57Bl/6 wild type  (WT)  
and CB 1−/−CB 2−/− female mice  were given Δ9-THC  (75 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days, 
surrounding the intranasal instillation of A/PR/8/34  influenza  virus. After influen za infection , a 
reduced influx of inflammatory myeloid cells and macrophages/monocytes  into the lung  was observed

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 46 in the Δ9-THC WT treated mice . Suppression of these antigen presenting cells  (APCs)  required the 
presence of CB 1 and/or CB 2. In vitro  investigations demonstrated that in bmDC, LPS induced 
maturation was suppressed by Δ9-THC , while  T cell responses were suppressed after treatment with 
Δ9-THC , which were also found to be dependent on CB 1 and/or CB 2. The authors sugge sted that these 
studies demonstrate host immune response suppression by Δ9-THC  against influenza virus challenge. 
The authors concluded that signaling initiated through CB 1 and CB 2 expressed on APCs  is critically 
involved in the Δ9THC–mediated reduction of  inflammatory responses in the lung after influenza 
infection.  The authors also concluded that  not all the immune modulatory properties of Δ9-THC  can 
be attributed to ligation of CB 1 and/or CB 2, as LPS- induced CD86 expression on bmDC was 
suppressed by Δ9-THC in both wild type mice and CB 1−/−CB 2−/− mice in vitro . 
The effects of perinatal exposure to Δ9-THC  in mice  was investigated  by Lombard et al. (2011). The 
authors confirmed through Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR ) that fetal 
thymo cytes exhibit CB 1 and CB 2. Pregnant mice were administered with Δ9-THC at a dose of 20 or 
50 mg/kg b.w. or vehicle on GD16. The findings indicated a decrease in thymic cellularity on GD 16, 
17, and 18 and postgestational day 1 and  marked alterations in T c ell subpopulations. As these 
outcomes were reversible using CB 1/CB 2 antagonists, it was suggested that the y were mediated 
through CB 1 and CB 2. Thymic atrophy induced in the fetus correlated with caspase -dependent 
apoptosis in thymocytes  and was considered to result from the direct action of Δ9-THC  and not due to  
maternal factors . The authors also noted that  perinatal exposure to Δ9-THC  affected  immune 
response s postnatal ly, as decreases were noted in proliferative response to T cell mitogen and in T cell 
and antibody responses  to HIV -1 p17/p2 4/gp120 antigens. The authors concluded that perinatal 
exposure to Δ9-THC triggers profound T cell dysfunction . 
In conclusion, inhibition of f unctional and/or biochemical immune parameters following Δ9-THC  
exposure were noted after a single dose of 10 mg/k g b.w . or following repeated dosing up to 14 days , 
in mice . Following exposure to Δ9-THC , apoptosis in bmDCs  from mice and in macrophages isolated 
from peritoneal cavity in mice have been demonstrated. Among the antigen presenting cells, 
inflammatory myeloi d cells and macrophages/monocytes were found to be the most sensitive to 
Δ9-THC.  Resistance to influenza virus was shown to be affected.  Perinatal exposure of mice to 
Δ9-THC caused fetal thymic atrophy and T cell dysfunction , postnatally.  
7.4.4.  Developmental and reproductive toxicity  
Reproduction studies with Δ9-THC have been performed in mice at 15 to 450 mg/m2 (5–150 mg/kg 
b.w.), corresponding to 0.2 to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 
90 mg/m2/day in cancer patients or 1 to 30 times the MRHD of 15 mg/m2/day in acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and in rats at 74 to 295 mg/m2 (12.3 –49.2 mg/kg b.w.) 
(corresponding to 0.8 to 3 times MRHD of 90 mg/m2/day in cancer patients or 5 to 20 times MRHD 
of 15 mg/m2/ day in AIDS patients). These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to 
Δ9-THC, but at these dosages in mice and rats Δ9-THC decreased maternal weight gain and number of 
viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early resorptions. These effects were dose dependent and 
less apparent at lower doses which produced less maternal toxicity (FDA, 2004). A study was 
designed in female rats to investigate the effects of Δ9-THC on the onset of puberty and to determine 
whether the exposure of prepubertal individuals to Δ9-THC could affect the reproductive function in 
the adulthood (Wenger et al., 1988). As compared to matched controls, the i.p. administration of 
Δ9-THC (1 µg/kg b.w. per day) from the PND22 delayed the vaginal opening by 2 days and reduced 
the number of ova ( 3.57 ± 0.34 vs 5.8 ± 0.51) on the day of estrus, while no effects on serum FSH, 
LH, and prolactin levels were observed. In addition, animals treated with the same protocol and 
sacrificed 35 –40 after vaginal opening showed irregular estrous cycles and decreased serum LH levels 
at all estrous stages. It is concluded that, even at low doses, Δ9-THC may cause a delay in the onset of 
puberty in female rats and permanent alterations in reproductive functions in adult female individuals. 
In conclusion, there is no evidence of teratogenicity following exposure to Δ9-THC in rodent studies. 
Other findings in reproduction studies in rats and mice include a decrease in maternal weight gain,

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 47 decreases in the number of viable pups, an increase in fetal mortality and early resorptions. Δ9-THC 
and other cannabinoids may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis mainly via the interaction 
with CB 1 receptor expressed in the hypothalamus, mainly resulting in a depression of the reproductive 
hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone. 
7.4.5.  Neurotoxicity  
The animal data are derived from experiments where Δ9-THC was administered i.p., s.c., i.v., or 
orally, and includes behavioural endpoints as well as cell death and enzyme activity. Sprague-Dawley 
rats exposed to 0.15 mg/kg b.w. per day (i.v.) from GD1 until delivery displayed no alterations in 
associative learning at PND22 (juvenile); no alterations in spatial navigation and short-term memory, 
but only subtle decrease in attention at PND45 (young adult); but decreased responsiveness to 
amphetamine at PND60 (adult) (Silva et al., 2012). Wistar rats were exposed to 5 mg/kg b.w. per day 
Δ9-THC (oral) from GD15 until PND9 and were investigated at PND80 (young adult stage) 
(Campolongo et al., 2007). The investigators found that the rats exposed to Δ9-THC displayed 
impaired learning (passive avoidance test) and social recognition, associated with alterations in the 
expression of genes related to glutamatergic and noradrenergic systems and lower basal levels of 
glutamate and NE in the cerebral cortex. Notably, genes related to apoptosis were found to be 
upregulated by the exposure to Δ9-THC during development. Similarly, adult (PND90) Long-Evans 
rats exposed to 4 mg/kg b.w. per day (s.c.) from GD1 until PND10 displayed anxiety-like behaviour 
and 
reduced social interactions (Newsom and Kelly, 2008). In female mice, administration of 5 mg/kg 
b.w. per day p.o. between GD5 and PND24 increased only the vertical activity in the open field, and 
had no effect on horizontal activity, inactivity or stereotypies (Garcia-Gil et al., 1999). A consistent 
finding was the decreased responsiveness to amphetamine in mice exposed to 0.15 mg/kg 
b.w. per day i.v. throughout gestation (Silva et al., 2012), or in adult male rats after chronic exposure 
to 1 mg/kg/day i.p. (Ginovart et al., 2012) (however, with this protocol no change in locomotor 
activity with THC alone were observed).  
Other studies on the effects of Δ9-THC on locomotor activity showed hyperactivity following single 
administration of 0.1 or 1 mg/kg b.w. i.p. (Katsidoni et al., 2013), and depressed locomotor activity 
(in juvenile rats after chronic exposure to 2 mg/kg/day i.p. PND22 –40, or PND41-60 (Harte and Dow-
Edwards, 2010)). In adult male mice, acute administration of Δ9-THC > 10 mg/kg b.w. i.p. suppressed 
spontaneous locomotion (Kochman et al., 2006).  
Chronic administration in adults (1 mg/kg b.w. per day i.p., 21 days) reduces social interactions in 
male mice (Long et al., 2013). 
Several studies using single exposure to low doses of Δ9-THC have shown effects on learning and 
memory. Amal et al. (2010) have shown that single administration of Δ9-THC doses of 0.002 mg/kg 
b.w. i.p. induces behavioural alterations (impaired learning) detectable several weeks later in mice. 
Similarly, mice that received a single dose of 0.001 mg/kg b.w. i.p. displayed impaired learning 
ability 21 days after administration (delayed acquisition and impaired reversal of acquired task (Senn 
et al., 2008); longer escape latency in Morris water maze (MWM) (spatial memory task), (Tselnicker 
et al., 2008). In rats, acute administration of 0.01 or 1 mg/kg b.w. Δ9-THC i.p. decreased the ability to 
reverse stimulus reward association and shift cognitive set, without changing the ability to shift 
attentional set (Egerton et al., 2005).  
Chronic administration of Δ9-THC impaired short-term memory in adolescent and adult male rat s 
(3 mg/kg/day i.p. (Wiley and Burston, 2010); 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg b.w. i.p. (Abdel-Salam et al., 2013) 
(LOEL 5 mg/kg b.w.)).  
Chronic administration of Δ9-THC in adult rats (10 mg/kg b.w. per day i.p. for 7 or 21 days, or 
2 × 5 mg/kg b.w. per day i.p. for 14 days), in addition to inducing tolerance (as illustrated by reduced 
effects on core temperature, glucose uptake, catalepsy and spontaneous activity (Wu and French, 
2000; Whitlow et al., 2003), increases the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 48 area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (Wu and French, 2000). Even lower doses (1.5 mg/kg 
b.w. per day i.p. for 7 days) stimulate neuronal plasticity in mouse brain regions related to addiction 
(e.g. VTA, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)) by upregulating the 
expression of brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) (Butovsky et al., 2005). A dose of 
2 × 10 mg/kg b.w. per day i.p. for 14 days induces attention impairment that is reversed by 
am
fetamine (Verrico et al., 2004) in adult male rats, while longer term administration of a lower dose 
(5.6 mg/kg b.w. per day i.p. for 40 days) induces alterations in operant learning that are dependent on 
the oestrous cycle and are reversed by ovariectomy in adolescent rat females (Winsauer et al., 2010).  
Neither acute (1-30 mg/kg b.w. i.p.), nor chronic administration (20 –80 mg/kg b.w. per day p.o. for 
21 days) had significant effects on hippocampal neurogenesis (Kochman et al., 2006). 
A paper by Downer et al reported that the brain is more sensitive to Δ9-THC during development than 
in adult life (Downer et al., 2007). Thus, Δ9-THC induced the activation of JNK and Caspase-3 in 
cortical slices obtained from neonate rats from 5 microM, while similar effects were noted from 
50 microM in slices obtained from adult rats. These effects were blocked by pre-incubation with CB 1 
receptor antagonist AM251. In addition, administration of 10 mg/kg b.w. in a single s.c. injection 
induced activation of JNK and Caspase-3, as well as DNA fragmentation 2 hours after Δ9-THC 
administration in neonates, but not in adult rats. Similarly, 1 mg/kg b.w. in a single s.c. injection 
induced activation of Cathepsin-D in the cytosolic fraction of cortical homogenates 2 hours after 
administration in neonates, while similar effects were not detectable in adult injected with either 1 or 
30 mg/kg b.w. Δ9-THC. (Downer et al., 2007). The study by Hansen and collaborators reports that 
doses of Δ9-THC that do not have detrimental effects alone (1 or 10 mg/kg b.w. s.c.) strongly 
potentiate the effects of ethanol, phenobarbital (GABA receptor agonist) and dizocilpine ( N-methyl-
D-aspartate ( NMDA)-type glutamate receptor antagonist) on apoptosis induction in the cerebral 
cortex of seven day-old rats insults (Hansen et al., 2008). This effect was absent in CB 1R knock-out 
mice, and were counteracted by the CB 1receptor antagonist SR141716A (Hansen et al., 2008).  
In conclusion, the effects of Δ9-THC in experimental models can be summarised as alterations in 
locomotor activity and decreased responsiveness to amfetamine; reduced social interactions; impaired 
learning (see Appendix D). Importantly, these effects have been found not only immediatel y 
following acute or chronic administration of Δ9-THC, but also in adult animals that had been exposed 
to Δ9-THC during development. While the effects on activity have a biphasic dose-dependence curve, 
the impairment of learning and memory are consistent across most studies (exception: Silva et al., 
2012), and appear to be long lasting even after single administration of very low doses, which may be 
relevant for human exposure. A number of studies have found long-term effects of developmental 
exposure to Δ9-THC in adult animals, and there is experimental evidence that the brain is more 
sensitive during development than in adults (Downer et al., 2007), and that doses of Δ9-THC that do 
not have detrimental effects alone strongly potentiate the effects of additional chemical insults 
(Hansen et al., 2008).  
7.4.6.  Genotoxicity 
From studies performed under the US National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1996) Δ9-THC was not 
mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains (TA97, TA98,TA100, or TA1535) with or without rat 
and hamster liver S9 fractions. Δ9-THC induced sister chromatid exchanges only at the highest dose 
tested (12.5 pg/mL) in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, in the presence of S9; at this dose level, 
cell cycle delay indicative of toxicity was observed. Δ9-THC did not induce chromosomal aberrations 
in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes. There were 
no increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of male or female 
mice obtained after 13 weeks of dosing Δ9-THC orally by gavage at doses of 0, 50, 150 and 
500 mg/kg b.w. per day. 
In a study by Koller et al. (2013) the capacity of Δ9‑THC to induce DNA breakage was tested in the 
human buccal (TR146), breast (MCF -7) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines by single cel l gel

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 49 electrophoresis (SCGE). In the HepG2 cells Δ9‑THC at concentrations of 100 µM induced a 
significant increase of DNA damage (measured as percentage of DNA in the tail ). No DNA breakage 
was detected  in the other cell lines upon exposure to the same dos es of Δ9‑THC. DNA damage 
induction was also investigated by Parolini and Binelli (2014) using the SCGE assay and the 
micronucleus assay in a study with zebra mussels ( Dreissena polymorpha ) exposed to 0.05  µg/L 
(0.16  nM) or 0.5  µg/L(1.6 nM) of Δ9‑THC for 14  days. Time and concentration dependent increases 
in the mean % of DNA in the comet tail (43  % higher at 0.5 µg/L compared to the control) and 
increases in micronucleated frequency (values 3 -fold higher at 0.5 µg/L compared to the control) were 
noted. At t he higher concentration alterations in oxidative status, leading to increase of lipid 
peroxidation and protein carbonylation were also noted.  
In conclusion, although Δ9-THC has shown some limited effects on DNA damage in vitro, the 
available evidence indicate that it is not genotoxic  in vivo . 
7.4.7.  Carcinogenicity 
Under the US National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1996) 2-year oral gavage carcinogenicity studies 
were performed in male and female F344/N rats at doses of 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg b.w. per day and 
in male and female B6C3F1 mice at doses of 0, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg b.w. per day. Increased 
incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas were noted for male and female mice at 
125 mg/kg b.w. per day providing equivocal evidence23 of carcinogenic activity of Δ9-THC in male 
and female B6C3Fl mice. Other findings included a decreased incidence of mammary gland 
fibroadenomas and uterine stromal polyps were  noted in female rats, and decreased incidences of 
pancreatic adenomas, pituitary gland adenomas, and interstitial cell adenomas of the testis noted in 
male rats. In mice, decreased incidences of liver adenomas and carcinomas were noted. NTP (1996) 
suggested that these decreases were likely to be related to lower body weights in dosed animals (see 
Section 7.4.2).  
7.5. Human pharmacological and toxicological data  
The use of parts of the plant C. sativa . and their preparations as a recreational psychoactive drug is 
widespread throughout the world. Potential health consequences of cannabis use were the subject of 
many investigations. Since these usually refer to exposure via smoked cannabis products, their 
outcome is only of limited value for the risk assessment of oral intake of cannabinoids as food 
contaminants. On the other hand more defined data on dose related pharmacological and toxicological 
effects are available due to the oral medical use of cannabinoids and especially Δ9-THC in a diversity 
of preparations and may be used as a basis for the risk assessment of food contaminated with 
cannabinoids. 
A large number of clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic applications of preparations or components 
derived from C. sativa have been published. The clinical trials performed in the period 1975 to June 
2005 have been summarised in a review by Ben Amar (2006). The period from July 2005 up to 
August 2009 (July included) was covered by a follow up review by Hazekamp and Grotenhermen 
(2010) based on a systematic search, focussed on clinical studies that were randomised, (double) 
blinded, and placebo-controlled. Wang et al. (2008) performed a systematic review of safety studies 
of cannabinoid-based medicine published over the past 40 years. A total of 321 articles were eligible 
for evaluation, from which 31 studies (23 randomised controlled trials and eight observational studies) 
were included in the review. Some 4 779 adverse events were reported in patients receiving a 
medicinal cannabinoid for 8 –12 months. Most (4 615 [96.6 %] events) were not serious, with the most 
common nonserious event being dizziness (714 [15.5 %] events) in people exposed to cannabinoids. 
Other systematic reviews have been published focussing mostly on efficacy in the treatment of certain 
medical conditions with C. sativa based medicine (Campbell et al., 2001; Tramèr et al., 2001; 
                                                 
23  Equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that are interpreted as showing a marginal increase 
of neoplasms that may be chemical related (NTP, 1996).

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 50 Machado Rocha et al., 2008; Lakhan and Rowland, 2009; Martin-Sanchez et al., 2009; Lynch and 
Campbell, 2011; van den Elsen et al., 2014). A recent condensed review on pharmacological and 
clinical effects of C. sativa derived medicine is also given by Borgelt et al. (2013). 
In view of the enormous number of studies on health effects in humans of C. sativa derived products 
and substances in the scientific literature, the CONTAM Panel decided to present in this risk 
assessment only a selection of relevant original papers, reviews, monographs, pharmaceutical fact 
sheets and reports on oral or peroral exposure and dose-response relationships of well defined 
components and preparations of C. sativa  in humans focussing especially on data regarding low doses 
and threshold doses of health-relevant effects, the main focus being on (−)-trans -Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC). 
For human toxicokinetic data see Section 7.1. 
7.5.1.   (−)-trans -Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) 
Δ9-THC is the most relevant constituent derived from the C. sativa  plant, producing a myriad of 
effects in humans. Pure Δ9-THC can be derived by extraction from C. sativa  or can be produced 
synthetically. In the medical field Δ9-THC is also known under the international non-proprietary name 
(INN)  dronabinol (FDA, 2004; Martindale, 2014a; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010). 
7.5.1.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Δ9-THC has complex effects on the human CNS  and influences the autonomic nervous system. The 
main therapeutic uses of Δ9-THC are the inhibition of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, 
mainly in cancer patients and the stimulation of appetite in the treatment of anorexia associated with 
weight loss in patients with AIDS. The exact mechanism of the antiemetic action of Δ9-THC is 
unknown but probably relates to stimulation of the CB 1 receptors on neurons in and around the 
vomiting cent re. Δ9-THC does not only demonstrate reversible effects on appetite but also on mood, 
cognition, memory, and perception in a dose-related way. These effects increase in frequency with 
higher dosages and are subject to great interindividual variability (FDA, 2004; Brunton et al., 2006, 
Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010). Δ9-THC is also used for the oral treatment of spasms and in 
chronic pain management (Haenseler, 2014). Some data suggest that Δ9-THC might improve 
symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010; Martindale, 
2014a). Regarding adverse effects accompanying therapeutical uses, psychotropic effects, such as 
euphoria (feeling ‘high’) and dizziness, are most prominent. In addition Δ9-THC shows pronounced 
cardiovascular effects, the most consistent being an increased pulse rate (Hart et al., 2005; Zuurman et 
al., 2009). In some studies heart rate slowing has been seen after Δ9-THC ingestion, especially after 
prolonged exposure (Benowitz and Jones, 1975, 1981; Noyes et al., 1975). Increased  blood pressure 
and orthostatic hypotension have also been observed (Benowitz and Jones, 1975, 1981). 
7.5.1.2.  Therapeutic applications and dosage  
Due to its antiemetic properties Δ9-THC is used for the control of nausea and vomiting associated 
with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional 
antiemetics. The usual initial oral dose of Δ9-THC is 5 mg/m2 (0.135 mg/kg b.w.) given 1 to 3 hours 
before the first dose of the antineoplastic drug with subsequent doses being given every 2 to 4 hours 
after chemotherapy to a maximum of four to six doses daily. If necessary, the dose may be increased 
by increments of 2.5 mg/m2 (0.041 mg/kg) to a maximum dose of 15 mg/m2 (0.405 mg/kg), if adverse 
effects permit. Most patients respond to 5 mg/person three or four times daily (FDA, 2004; Brunton et 
al., 2006; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010; Martindale, 2014a ). 
Δ9-THC also has appetite-stimulant effects and is used in the treatment of anorexia associated with 
weight loss in patients with AIDS. The intended therapeutic and adverse effects of orally administered 
Δ9-THC are dose-related and subject to considerable interindividual variability. Therefore, dosage 
individualisation is critical in achieving the best benefit-adverse effects relationship. For appetite-

adverse CNS sym ptoms (feeling ‘high’, dizziness, confusion, somnolence) may occur, but usually 
resolve in 1 to 3 days with continued dosage (FDA, 2004). In cases where the unwanted CNS 
symptoms are severe or persistent, a reduction to a single 2.5 mg dose/day given before supper is 
recommended. If symptoms continue to be a problem at a single dose of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day, taking 
the single dose in the evening or at bedtime is recommended to reduce the severity of adverse effects. 
If necessary, and if adverse effects permit, doses may also be increased up to a maximum of 20 mg 
Δ9-
THC daily in divided doses (FDA, 2004; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010; Martindale, 2014a ).  
In a fact sheet for a liquid formulation of Δ9-THC in oil (oral administration), for appetite-stimulation, 
treatment of spasms or in chronic pain management 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day is recommended as the usual 
initial dose and 1.65 mg Δ9-THC/day as low initial dose (Haenseler, 2014). 
Following oral administration, Δ9-THC has an onset of action after approximately half an hour to one 
hour and a peak effect occurs after 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 
6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect may continue for 24 hours or longer post administration 
(
FDA, 2004). 
7.5.1.3.  Adverse reactions, tolerance and dependence, intoxication and clinical studies 
Adverse reactions of Δ9-THC associated with therapeutic doses 
The most frequent adverse effects of orally administered Δ9-THC include abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting and symptoms known from marijuana ‘highs’, such as euphoria, somnolence, dizziness, 
detachment, anxiety, nervousness, panic, thinking abnormalities and paranoid reactions. Seizures and 
seizure-like activity have been reported. Related to its influence on the autonomic nervous system it 
may induce palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation, hypotension and conjunctival injection (bloodshot 
eyes) (Brunton et al., 2006; Martindale, 2014a).  
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) summarises information on adverse events derived 
from controlled clinical trials conducted in the US and US territories involving 474 patients exposed 
to Δ9-THC in capsules in a fact sheet (Tables 9 and 10) (FDA, 2004). Studies of patients suffering 
from AIDS-related weight loss included 157 individuals receiving Δ9-THC at a dose of 2.5 mg twice 
daily and 67 receiving placebo. Studies of different durations were combined by considering the first 
occurrence of events during the first 28 days. Studies of patients suffering from nausea and vomiting 
related to cancer chemotherapy included 317 patients receiving Δ9-THC and 68 receiving placebo. 
A Δ9-THC dose-rela ted feeling ‘high’ (easy laughing, elation and heightened awareness) has been 
reported by patients receiving Δ9-THC capsules in both the antiemetic (24 %) and the lower dose 
appetite stimulant clinical trials (8 %).  
The most frequently reported adverse events in patients suffering from AIDS during placebo-
controlled clinical trials involved the CNS and were reported by 33 % of patients receiving the verum. 
About 25 % of patients reported a minor CNS adverse event during the first 2 weeks and about 4 % 
reported such an experience each week for the next 6 weeks thereafter.

Furthermore, effects of Δ9-THC on isolated cognitive functions and psychomotor skills impairing 
driving performances have been demonstrated (Chesher et al., 1990 ). Patients receiving treatment 
with Δ9-THC are specifically warned not to drive, operate machinery, or engage in any hazardous 
activity until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and to perform such tasks safely 
(FDA, 2004). 
Tolerance and dependence 
Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the pharmacologic effects of Δ9-THC, such as 
cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects, with chronic use. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do 
not, however, appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of Δ9-THC (FDA, 2004). 
Both psychological and physiological dependence have been noted in healthy individuals given oral 
Δ9-THC. However, addiction is uncommon and has only been observed after prolonged high dose 
administration (FDA, 2004; Brunton et al., 2006).  
Intoxications and adverse effects of Δ9-THC associated with over-dosage 
The acute toxicity of Δ9-THC is considered to be low. Fatal cases in humans have not been observed. 
Cases of unintentional ingestion of cannabinoids-containing drugs have been reported. In most cases 
symptoms are described to be short-lasting and not severe. Signs and symptoms following mild 
intoxication with Δ9-THC capsules comprise drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, 
altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry mouth and tachycardia. Symptoms of a moderate 
intoxication include memory impairment, depersonalization, mood alteration, urinary retention, and 
reduced bowel motility. In cases of severe intoxication patients show decreased motor coordination, 
lethargy, slurred speech, and postural hypotension (FDA, 2004; Marquardt and Schaefer, 2004).

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 53 Clinical studies in patients treated with Δ9-THC 
Struwe et al. (1993) conducted a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to 
examine the effect of Δ9-THC on appetite and nutritional status in male patients with symptomatic 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and weight loss. The patients were able to perform 
activities of daily life and were treated ambulatorily. Patients were eligible for this study when they 
had at least a 2.25 kg weight loss and when they agreed not to use any form of marijuana for one 
month prior to and for the duration of the study. A dose of 5 mg Δ9-THC or placebo were orally 
administered to patients twice daily before meals. Two dosage reductions (2.5 mg Δ9-THC twice daily 
or 2.5 mg Δ9-THC once daily) were permitted if intolerable adverse effects occurred. Two 5-week 
treatment periods in which patients received either verum or placebo were separated by a 2-week 
washout period and subjects were their own controls. From 12 patients who had been recruited, five 
patients completed the protocol taking 5 mg Δ9-THC twice daily in the active treatment phase. These 
five patients gained weight during the period they received Δ9-THC (median gain 0.5 kg) while, 
receiving placebo, three of them lost weight. The remaining seven patients withdrew from the 
treatment. The reasons for withdrawal were drug intolerance (two patients), disease progression (two 
patients), noncompliance (two patients) and experimental antiretroviral therapy (one patient). The two 
patients who did not tolerate Δ9-THC, even following dosage reduction decreased to 2.5 mg 
Δ9-THC/day, withdrew during the first period of active treatment due to mood altering effects and 
sedation.  
The effects of orally administered Δ9-THC in capsules, on appetite and weight, were investigated in 
139 patients, with anorexia related to AIDS and a weight loss of at least 2.3 kg from normal weight, in 
a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (Beal et al., 1995). Seventy two 
AIDS patients were randomised to receive 2.5 mg Δ9-THC twice a day (5 mg Δ9-THC/day) or a single 
dose of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day in case of not tolerated adverse effects and 67 AIDS patients to a 
matching placebo, for a duration of 6 weeks. Regarding past marijuana use, patients of the verum or 
placebo group respectively, reported none (41.7 or 47.8 %), < once monthly (26.4 or 23.9 %), 1 –
3 times monthly (13.9 or 11.9 %) or ≥ 4 times monthly (18.1 or 16.4  %). Most of the patients in both 
groups were males aged 22 to 64 years (average age: 39 years). All patients on the trial were at 
advanced stages of AIDS. No information was provided on mean group body weights in the published 
report. Appetite was measured using a visual analogue scale for hunger (VASH). Of the 139 patients 
entering the study, efficacy was evaluable in 88 patients (i.e., were followed for at least 4 of the 
6 weeks, took at least 75 % of the planned medication and had no major protocol violations). Δ9-THC 
was associated with increased appetite above baseline (38 % vs 8 % for placebo, p = 0.015), 
improvement in mood (10 % vs -2 %, p = 0.06), and decreased nausea (20 % vs 7 %; p = 0.05). 
Weight was stable in Δ9-THC patients, while placebo recipients had a mean loss of 0.4 kg ( p = 0.14). 
Of the Δ9-THC patients, 22 % gained > 2 kg, compared with 10.5 % of placebo recipients ( p = 0.11). 
Adverse events of Δ9-THC treatment were mostly affecting the nervous system and mild to moderate 
in severity. 43 % of the Δ9-THC group and 13 % of the placebo group noted treatment-related adverse 
events ( p < 0.001). The one cardiovascular event observed in the verum recipients was tachycardia 
resolving without sequelae on discontinuation of therapy. The difference in treatment related adverse 
events between treatment groups is due to the incidence of nervous system events, accounting for 
35 % in the Δ9-THC group and 9 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.001). The most common nervous 
system adverse events in the Δ9-THC group (individual dose of Δ9-THC administered not given) were 
euphoria (nine patients), dizziness (five patients), thinking abnormalities (five patients) and 
somnolence (four patients). In the placebo group dizziness was noted in two patients and the other 
experiences in one patient each. All adverse events related to study medication resolved without 
sequelae on decreasing dose or discontinuing treatment. Most patients who required dose reduction 
were able to tolerate the half-dose (2.5 mg Δ9-THC in the evening/day). Of 17 patients who received 
the half-dose, 11 were evaluable for efficacy and showed a similar appetite increase compared with 
those patients treated with 5 mg Δ9-THC/day. There was no significant difference in dropout rates due 
to adverse effects thought to be possibly or probably related to treatment between the verum (8.3 %) 
and the placebo (4.5 %) recipients ( p = 0.29). Based primarily on this study Δ9-THC was approved by 
the FDA as a treatment for anorexia associated with AIDS (Beal et al., 1995; FDA, 2004).

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 54 In 94 late-stage AIDS patients who previously participated in the 6-week study mentioned above 
(Beal et al., 1995) effects of long-term (12 months) oral treatment with Δ9-THC were investigated 
(Beal et al., 1997). Ninety four patients entered the study, their prior marijuana use was in the same 
range as in the preceding study (Beal et al., 1995). Efficacy was evaluable in 93 patients. Twenty two 
patients (24 %) completed the full treatment for 12-months. The remaining 71 patients (76 %) 
terminated treatment early. Patients received Δ9-THC in initial doses of 2.5 mg twice daily (90 %) or 
2.5 mg once daily in the evening (10 %). Thirty eight per cent of patients modified their Δ9-THC dose 
during the course of the trial. One-half of these patients increased their dose, most commonly to 
2.5 mg during the day and 5 mg with supper or at bedtime (total dose per day: 7.5 mg Δ9-THC). Two 
patients increased their dose to 5 mg Δ9-THC twice daily (total dose per day: 10 mg Δ9-THC) and 
another patient to 5 mg Δ9-THC twice daily plus 10 mg Δ9-THC at night (total dose per day: 20 mg 
Δ9-THC). The other one-half decreased their dose from 2.5 mg Δ9-THC twice daily to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC 
at bedtime. Δ9-THC was associated with consistent improvement in mean appetite measured using 
VASH. In patients previously treated with Δ9-THC, improvement in VASH continued (percent 
cha
nge from baseline of 6-week trial: 48.6 –76.1 % at each month), whereas those previously treated 
with placebo exhibited substantial improvement in mean appetite, especially during the initial 
4 months of Δ9-THC administration (48.5 –69.9 %). Thereafter, Δ9-THC was associated with a VASH 
change at least twice baseline. Patients tended toward stable body weight for at least seven months. 
Adverse events were primarily related to known CNS  effects of Δ9-THC (e.g. anxiety, confusion, 
depersonalisation, dizziness, euphoria, somnolence, thinking abnormalities) and occurred in 35 of the 
93 patients (38 %) evaluated in this study. In 19 patients, treatment-related adverse events were the 
primary or secondary reason for early study discontinuation (individual dose of Δ9-THC administered 
not known), including CNS  events (17 patients), asthenia (two patients), palpitations (two patients), 
tachycardia (one patient), and alcohol intolerance (one patient) (Beal et al., 1997). 
Noyes et al. (1975) investigated a possible analgesic effect of Δ9-THC when administered orally to 
10 patients experiencing cancer pain in single doses of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg Δ9-THC/day on 
successive days in a random sequence. Only one of the ten patients had a history of marijuana use. 
Each dose administration was followed by a 6-hour observation period. The study was performed as a 
randomised, double-blind crossover trial. At high daily dose levels (15 and 20 mg) pain relief was 
significantly superior to placebo. At these levels, substantial sedation and mental clouding were 
reported. With increase of the daily dose (placebo, 5,10, 15 and 20 mg Δ9-THC), a rising number of 
patients experienced the prominent side-effects such as drowsiness (3/7/5//7/10), slurred speech 
(2/4/4/8/8), blurred vision (0/2/4/7/7), mental clouding (2/5/4/7/6) and dizziness (1/2/4/4/6). 
Compared to placebo treatment these side-effects appeared more frequently at daily doses of 5 mg and 
became more marked at higher doses. Patients receiving 20 mg Δ9-THC/day were heavily sedated. 
Both heart rate and blood pressure decreased following administration of 15 or 20 mg Δ9-THC/day. 
The efficacy and adverse effects of Δ9-THC have been evaluated for the treatment of postoperative 
pain in 40 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. Randomisation took place and 
treatment with Δ9-THC started when postoperative patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued on 
the second postoperative day. Patients who requested further analgesia received orally a single 
capsule of either 5 mg Δ9-THC (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in a double-blind fashion. No evidence of 
an analgesic effect of orally administered 5 mg Δ9-THC in postoperative pain was found in this study. 
Increased awareness of surroundings was the only side-effect reported significantly more frequently 
in patients receiving Δ9-THC compared to placebo treatment (40 vs 5 %, p = 0.04). For other reported 
adverse events, such as drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, palpitations, change of mood, difficulty 
with memory, slurring of speech, blurred vision, headache, involuntary muscle twitching and tremor, 
there were no significant differences between both groups (Buggy et al., 2003). 
The effect of oral administration of Δ9-THC in capsules at a maximum dose of 10 mg daily or placebo 
on central neuropathic pain was investigated in 24 patients with multiple sclerosis aged between 
23 and 55 years in a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover trial. The initial dose was 
2.5 mg Δ9-THC daily, and the dose was increased by 2.5 mg every other day to a maximum dose of

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 55 5 mg given twice daily. The active capsules contained a solution of Δ9-THC in sesame oil, and the 
placebo capsules contained pure sesame oil. After 18 –21 days of dosing, treatment was discontinued 
by a three week washout period before the next treatment period started. If adverse events occurred 
the dose was reduced to a minimum of 2.5 mg daily. Adverse events were more frequent during 
Δ9-THC treatment than during placebo treatment especially in the first week of treatment. During 
Δ9-THC treatment 23 (96 %) patients had adverse events compared with 11 (46 %) patients during 
placebo treatment ( p = 0.001, Mainland-Gart test). While 11 patients had adverse events in both 
treatment periods; none had adverse events during placebo treatment only. Because of intolerable 
adverse events during active treatment, four (17 %) patients had to reduce their doses (three patients 
to 7.5 mg daily and one patient to 5 mg daily). In all four patients the reduction of dose decreased the 
side-effects. The rest of the patients had no need for dose reduction during active treatment and was 
treated with 10 mg daily. The most common adverse events during Δ9-THC treatment were related to 
the CNS  (dizziness, light-headedness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache) and the musculoskeletal 
system (myalgia, muscle weakness). Regarding the percentages of patients with adverse events during 
active and placebo treatment, a significant difference was only seen for the combined adverse effect 
of dizziness and light-headedness (58 % versus 17%; p < 0.05). From the results of the efficacy 
testing the authors concluded that Δ9-THC had a modest but clinically relevant analgesic effect on 
central pain in patients with multiple sclerosis (Svendsen et al., 2004). 
Studies in healthy volunteers including marijuana users, and volunteers with marijuana use disorders 
A randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled trial was conducted to compare the acute 
pharmacological effects of Δ9-THC and CBD  by Martin-Santos et al. (2012) (see Section 7.5.3). 
G
ray et al. (2008) investigated the tolerability and effects of oral Δ9-THC in a group of older 
adolescents with marijuana use disorders in a double-blind study. The CONTAM Panel noted that the 
results of this study is only of limited relevance since the participants may have developed tolerance 
due to their marijuana use disorders. 
Chesher et al. (1990) examined the effect of Δ9-THC dissolved in sesame oil and orally administered 
in capsules on skill performance, cognitive function and mood at dose levels of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg 
Δ9-THC/person of 70 kg b.w. in a double-blinded way. Eighty students of both sexes (23 females, 
57 males), with a body weight range of 58 to 84 kg (median: 64.5 kg) were divided into groups of 
16 v
olunteers each. All were non-naïve regarding cannabis use (16 subjects: once per month or less; 
64 subjects: once per week or more). Dosage levels were adjusted to deliver approximately 0.070, 
0.14, 0.215, or 0.286 mg Δ9-THC /kg b.w. The test battery included measurements of standing 
steadiness, hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and arithmetic skills and a self-assessment of the 
degree of intoxication (0 = being completely ‘straight’; 10 = being ‘stoned as I have ever been’). The 
subjects repeated the test battery after the pretreatment control run for several times (80, 140, 200, 
260 minutes after dosage). The slope of the linear regression of performance on the test battery was 
significant for up to 200 minutes after dosage. From the results the authors concluded that oral Δ9-
THC, at all doses tested, produced significant dose-dependent impairment of performance for a period 
of more than three hours, the most striking effects being those on the arithmetic test and the standing 
steadiness test. Regarding the self-assessment of intoxication, on the self-reporting scale, the lowest 
dose level (5 mg/70 kg-person) was not distinguishable from placebo, but there was a dose-related 
effect reported at the higher dose levels. According to the authors, the results suggest ed a correlation 
between drug-induced impairment skills and the effects on mood. 
The Panel noted shortcomings in the statistical evaluation of the study by Chesher et al. (1990).  
Furthermore, the Panel noted that subjects were non-naïve regarding cannabis use and heavier users 
among them may have developed tolerance, making them less sensitive to certain Δ9-THC effects. 
In a study with randomised, double-blind, within-subjects design the effects on subjective, cognitive, 
and physiological measures of a single doses of Δ9-THC and of ethanol administered alone and in 
combination were assessed in healthy volunteers aged 21 –35 years (n = 11). The participants received

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 56 capsules containing placebo or Δ9-THC (2.5 mg), and beverages containing placebo or ethanol 
(0.1 and 0.2 g/kg) alone and in combination, across separate sessions. Candidates were accepted when 
they had cannabis use only between two and 10 times in the lifetime but not more than four times in 
the last month. Participants were asked not to smoke cannabis within the week preceding the session. 
During each session, subjects completed measures of working memory, psychomotor ability, and 
simple reaction time, and had to provide subjective mood and drug effect ratings. At regular intervals 
measures of blood pressure and heart rate were obtained. When administered alone 2.5 mg Δ9-THC 
had moderate effects on isolated measures (increased sedation, altered scale scores in the Profile of 
Mood States (POMS, slightly impaired working memory performance and reduced diastolic blood 
pressure). Combination of the two substances did not result in synergistic effects and were reported, in 
some cases, to be less than additive. After exposure to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC, participants did not report 
feeling any drug effects. From their results the authors concluded that the dose of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC was 
a threshold dose (Ballard and Wit, 2011). 
7.5.1.4.  Sensitive subpopulations and interactions in Δ9-THC- treatment 
Therapeutical recommendations say that Δ9-THC should be used with caution in persons with a 
history of seizure disorders and in those with a history of substance abuse (FDA, 2004; Brunton et al., 
2006; Martindale, 2014a). Furthermore patients with cardiac disorders should use it with caution 
because of the risk of occasional hypotension, possible hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia. Caution 
and careful psychiatric monitoring is necessary in patients with mania, depression, or schizophrenia 
because treatment with Δ9-THC may exacerbate these illnesses (FDA, 2004). 
Pregnant women 
Δ9-THC crosses the placenta (Martindale, 2014a).  
No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women are available. Against this background it 
is recommended to only use Δ9-THC therapeutically if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus (FDA, 2004). 
Breastfed children 
US licensed product information states that Δ9-THC is concentrated in breast milk and recommends 
that it should not be used in breast-feeding mothers (FDA, 2004; Martindale, 2014a).  
Children 
Δ9-THC is not recommended for the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia in paediatric patients due to 
lack of safety and efficacy data in this population. The paediatric dosage for the treatment of emesis 
induced by chemotherapy is the same as in adults. Caution is recommended in prescribing for children 
because of the psychoactive effects of Δ9-THC (FDA, 2004). 
Elderly 
Caution is advised in prescribing Δ9-THC in elderly patients because they may be more sensitive t o 
the neurological, psychoactive and postural hypotensive effects of the drug (FDA, 2004). Van den 
Elsen et al. (2014) concluded in their systematic review which included randomised controlled trials 
with a total of 267 participants (mean age 47 –78 years), aiming to integrate the evidence on 
indications, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of medical cannabinoids in older subjects, that 
adequately powered trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids in the elderly. 
Interactions 
Δ9-THC is extensively metabolised, mainly in the liver by CYP  isoenzymes; the primary metabolite, 
11-hydroxy Δ9-THC is also active. Therefore interactions might be expected with drugs that are 
metabolised by these enzymes like phenytoin (Bland et al., 2005 ) (Martindale, 2014a,b) (see also 
Section 7.1.3).

=== PAGINA 57 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 57 Because of its high affinity for plasma proteins, Δ9-THC can displace other plasma-protein-bound 
drugs, whose doses may have to be newly adjusted as a consequence (FDA, 2004; Brunton et al., 
2006). Δ9-THC can interact with alcohol. There is a potential for additive or synergistic CNS effects 
when Δ9-THC intake occurs concomitantly to therapy with sedatives, hypnotics or other psychoactive 
drugs (FDA, 2004). 
7.5.2.  (−)-trans -Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) 
The conc entrations in which (−) -trans -Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) occurs in preparations of 
C. sativa  are said to be usually minuscule and not contributing significantly to their activity 
(Williamson and Evans, 2000; Izzo et al., 2009). Izzo et al. (2009) des cribe that (−) -trans -Δ8-
tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) is in general regarded as an artefact in these preparations  resulting 
from the isomerisation of Δ9-THC.  
Hollister and Gillespie (1973) compared the effects of single doses of Δ8-THC (20 and 40 mg) and of 
Δ9-THC (20 mg) orally administered to six human volunteers in three trials. The spectrum of the 
resulting clinical effects was qualitatively similar for both isomers, but the lower dose of Δ8-THC 
produced the least effects, having a slower onset and a shorter duration compared to the other 
treatments. Early effects included dizziness, dryness of mucous membranes, incoordination and 
sleepiness. Among the perceptual effects reported were blurring vision, enhancement of colours, time 
distortion and decreased discrimination of hearing. Psychic effects included euphoria, tranquillity, 
difficulties in thinking, speaking or remembering. Under the conditions of the test (the subjects were 
mostly recumbent), the mean maximal increase of pulse rates for 20 mg Δ8-THC, 40 mg Δ8-THC and 
20 mg Δ9-THC were 7, 12 and 10 beats per minute, respectively. Reddening of conjunctivas was 
uniformly observed after treatment with 40 mg Δ8-THC or 20 mg Δ9-THC, but was less severe and 
once absent following the administration of 20 mg Δ8-THC. In the global rating the dose of 20 mg 
Δ8-THC produced the lowest mean score of 2.2, compared to a mean score of 3.5 for the same dose of 
Δ9-THC and a mean score of 6.3 for 40 mg Δ8-THC. Comparing the potencies of Δ8-THC to Δ9-THC 
the authors considered the ratio to be approximately 2:3.  
Abrahamov et al. ( 1995) investigated efficacy and adverse effects of Δ8-THC given as an antiemetic 
drug to eight children, aged 3 –13 years suffering from various hematologic cancers (e.g. Hodgkin’s 
disease, B urkitt’s lymphoma, Wilm’s tumour) and treated with different antineoplastic drugs for up to 
8 months. Children received Δ8-THC only during days when emetogenic drugs were given. Δ8-THC 
was orally administered in single doses of (18 mg/m2 in corn or olive oil), starting the treatment 
2 hours before the antineoplastic drug was given and continuing the treatment every 6 hours for 
24 hours (four single doses per day). Δ8-THC was administered to each patient following this time 
schedule, whenever cycles of antineoplastic therapy were required. The total number of resulting 
treatment cycles with Δ8-THC was 480. Vomiting was completely prevented by the treatment with 
Δ8-THC. For six of the eight children no side-effects were reported, while the remaining two children 
showed slight irritability, which was associated with euphoria in one case. No anxiety or 
hallucinogenic effects were noted. 
7.5.3.  Cannabidiol (CBD) 
Cannabidiol (CBD) has been identified as the major non-psychotropic cannabinoid in C. sativa . There 
is controv ersial information on the interactions between Δ9-THC and CBD.  It is said to have 
neuroprotective, anti -psychotic, anti -inflammatory, anti -emetic and muscle relaxing activity, and to 
reduce psychotropic effects and tachycardia produced by Δ9-THC (Russo and Guy, 2006 ; Pertwee, 
2012). However, studies ex amining the interactions between Δ9-THC and CBD do not always report 
antagonistic effects . According to Karniol et al. (1974) higher doses of CBD reduced the acceleration 
of pulse rate induced by Δ9-THC while lower doses of CBD could enhance this effect of  Δ9-THC (see 
below). In addition, one of the few studies performed on human volunteers (Hollister and Gillespie, 
1975), reported that the association of oral Δ9-THC  (20 mg) and C BD (40 mg) tended to prolong the 
psychological and cardiovascular effects comp ared with those recorded in subjects treated with

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 58 Δ9-THC alone. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. CBD is described to have 
no considerable affinity to CB 1 receptors, but it displays complex actions on other cannabinoid 
targets, being an inverse agonist at CB 2 receptors and an inhibitor of the endocannabinoid anandamide 
inactivation (Pertwee, 2008; Izzo et al., 2009). Higher doses of CBD can potentiate the effects of 
lower doses of Δ9-THC by enhancing the level of CB 1 receptor expression in the hippocampus and 
hypothalamus (Russo and Guy, 2006; Aktories et al., 2009 ; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010; 
Ashton, 2001). On the other hand, several in vitro  studies have shown that CBD is a powerful 
inhibitor of several human CYPs, including those belonging to the 2C and 3A families, which are 
responsible for the oxidative biotransformation of Δ9-THC (Stout and Cimino, 2014), and is able to 
reduce the formation of Δ9-THC  metabolites when preincubated with liver human microsomes (Jaeger 
et al., 1996). Accordingly, as reflected by the plasma levels of Δ9-THC, 11 -OH-THC, a partial 
inhibition of the  hydroxylation of Δ9-THC to 11 -OH-Δ9-THC was reported in male and female 
volunteers orally dosed with cannabis extract containing 10 mg Δ9-THC +5.4 mg CBD with respect to 
those receiving 10 mg Δ9-THC alone (Nadulski et al., 2005). Conversely, no such effec ts were noticed 
in cannabis smokers treated with a similar protocol (Karschner et al., 2011).   
Clinical studies in patients treated with CBD 
In a double-blind study in 10 patients with generalised social anxiety disorder an oral dose of 400 mg 
CBD significantly reduced subjective anxiety compared to placebo. Based on the results of single 
photon emission computed tomography it was concluded that this effect may be related to the activity 
of CBD on limbic and paralimbic brain areas (Crippa et al., 2011). 
CBD was tested in a double-blind procedure for anticonvulsive activity in 15 patients (aged 14 to 
49 years) with secondarily generalised epilepsy. Patients continued to take the antiepileptic drugs 
prescribed before to which the patients did not respond satisfactory. Individuals were randomly 
divided into two groups and received placebo (seven subjects) or 200 to 300 mg CBD/day (eight 
subjects) for 6 to 18 weeks. From the results the authors concluded that CBD has a beneficial effect, 
which may be due to possibly potentiating the action of the anticonvulsants given in parallel. Four of 
the eight patients receiving the active treatment complained of somnolence during the trial. The 
CONTAM Panel noted that also this adverse effect cannot clearly be associated with the 
administration of CBD but could be influenced by the effects of anticonvulsants given in addition to 
CBD (Cunha et al., 1980; Carlini and Cunha, 1981). 
Studies in healthy volunteers including marijuana users, and volunteers with marijuana use disorders 
Eff
ects of single oral administrations of 30 mg Δ9-THC and of 15, 30 or 60 mg CBD were studied 
alone and in combination of the two substances in a double-blind placebo controlled trial in 40 male 
subjects (eight groups of five volunteers) in Brazil (Karniol et al., 1974). Twenty two of the subjects 
reported previous occasional consumption of marijuana . Pulse rate, results of a ‘time production 
tasks’ (task to estimate a time period of 60 seconds) and individual estimates of feelings and 
sensations (psychological reactions were graded from 0 to 4) were recorded. In all five subjects 
receiving 30 mg Δ9-THC alone an accentuated acceleration of pulse rate averaging 35 % increase was 
measured 50 minutes after the treatment as compared to the pre-drug levels. At this point of time 
Δ9-THC in mixture with 15 mg CBD increased pulse rate by 53 % in comparison to the pre-drug 
levels. However, 30 or 60 mg CBD in mixture with Δ9-THC reduced the acceleration of pulse rate 
induced by Δ9-THC. CBD alone did not significantly change pulse rate at doses of 15 –60 mg. Intake 
of 30 mg of Δ9-THC induced an ‘underproduction’ in the time task. This effect was counteracted by 
CBD in all tested doses. Fifteen to 60 mg CBD alone were practically without an effect in the time 
task. 30 mg of Δ9-THC induced strong psychological reactions and symptoms appeared in ‘waves’ 
during which the subjects reported strong feelings of anxiety reaching sometimes a near panic state. 
The reactions were scored as the maximum grade of four, in four out of the five individuals tested. 
With addition of CBD these Δ9-THC effects were weaker, even in the lowest dose of 15 mg CBD. 
The authors observed that ‘CBD also changed the symptoms in such a way that the subjects receiving 
the mixtures showed less anxiety and panic but reported more pleasurable effects’. Ingestion of

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 59 placebo or CBD alone did not provoke psychological reactions except in two subjects (one received 
15 and the other 30 mg of CBD) showing discrete reactions recorded as grade 1. 
Eight volunteers received the following treatments in a placebo-controlled, double-blind procedure as 
single oral dose in a different sequence: 0.5 mg Δ9-THC/kg b.w., 1 mg CBD/kg b.w., a mixture 
containing 0.5 mg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. and 1 mg CBD/kg b.w. (assuming a body weight of 70 kg/person 
corresponding to doses of: 35 mg Δ9-THC, 70 mg CBD, a mixture containing 35 mg Δ9-THC and 
70 mg CBD). From the results recorded within a time interval of 3 hours following ingestion, the 
authors concluded that CBD blocked the anxiety and other subjective marijuana-like effects but not 
the increase in pulse-rate provoked by Δ9-THC (Zuardi et al.,1982).  
A randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled trial was conducted to evaluate and 
compare the acute pharmacological effects of single doses of both Δ9-THC and CBD  in human 
volunteers. Doses of 10 mg Δ9-THC or 600 mg CBD or a placebo were administered orally to 
16 healthy male subjects in three consecutive sessions, at 1-month interval. Before drug 
administration and at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment, physiological measures of blood pressure and 
hea
rt rate and symptom ratings (including measurements of psychotic syndrome, mood, sedation, 
intellectual or bodily impairment, anxiety effects, types of feelings, euphoria, dysphoria) were 
assessed. Relative to both, placebo and CBD, treatment with Δ9-THC was associated with anxiety, 
dysphoria, positive psychotic symptoms, physical and mental sedation, subjective intoxication (AUC 
and effect at 2 hours: p < 0.01) and an increase in heart rate ( p < 0.05). There were no differences 
between CBD and placebo on any symptomatic, physiological variable. Thus the authors concluded 
that in healthy volunteers Δ9-THC has marked acute behavioural and physiological effects, whereas 
CBD is well tolerated (Martin-Santos et al., 2012). 
There are a number of newer double-blind studies published by a group of authors comparing the 
effects of 10 mg of Δ9-THC, 600 mg of CBD and placebo, each orally administered alone as single 
dose to healthy volunteers who had previous minimal exposure to cannabis (Borgwardt et al., 2008 ; 
Bhattacharyya et al., 2009; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Winton-Brown et al., 2011). The subjects 
participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while performing a response 
inhibition task, a verbal memory task, an emotional task (viewing fearful faces) or an auditory and 
visual sensory processing task. Overall results showed that Δ9-THC caused transient psychotic 
symptoms and increased the levels of anxiety, intoxication and sedation. CBD had no significant 
effect on behaviour or these parameters. At times, Δ9-THC and CBD showed opposing brain 
activation in various regions (Borgwardt et al. 2008; Bhattacharyya et al. 2009; Fusar-Poli et al. 2009; 
Winton-Brown et al. 2011; Atakan, 2012 ). 
I
nteractions  
A daily oral dose of 600 mg CBD/day given for 5 to 12 days to 10 subjects, inhibited metabolism of 
hexobarbital resulting in an increase of hexobarbital biovailability (Benowitz et al., 1980).  
7.5.4.  Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV) 
Hollister (1974) investigated the effects of Δ9-THCV, which may in some cannabis variants represent 
20–30 % of the cannabinoids present, in human volunteers. In an experiment, in which six subjects 
received a single i.v. dose of 7 mg of Δ9-THCV, there were no detectable effects in one individual but 
mild to moderate effects, similar in most respects to those obtained from Δ9-THC, in the five 
remaining subjects. The author concluded that ‘one would estimate the potency of this compound to 
be 25 % that of Δ9-THC’  (Hollister, 1974).  
7.5.5.  Further cannabinoids 
No relevant human data were available on adverse effects for other cannabinoids described as 
constituents of C. sativa  with a potential for pharmacological activity  (Izzo et al., 2009; Williamson

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 60 and Evans, 2000 ), such as cannabinoid acids (Δ9-THCA- A and Δ9-THCA-B and cannabidiolic acid), 
cannabinol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene and olivetol.  
7.5.6.  Extracts of Cannabis sativa 
Extracts of C. sativa  containing standardised concentrations of Δ9-THC and CBD are available for 
medical purposes and have been subject to clinical studies using buccal (oromucosal) or oral 
administration (Aktories et al., 2009; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010; Borgelt et al., 2013). Only 
the latter is considered to be relevant for this assessment. 
7.5.6.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
The purpose of the combination of Δ9-THC and CBD within the botanical preparation is that CBD is 
expected to reduce the adverse effects of Δ9-THC, such as sedation and tachycardia, without 
interfering with its desired effects, e.g. in antiemetic therapy. The mechanism of this potential 
interaction is not known (Russo and Guy, 2006; Aktories et al., 2009). Psychotropic effects induced 
by Δ9-THC are not observed after administration of CBD (see Section 7.5.3).  
Δ9-THC and CBD are described by some authors as having almost opposing effects to one another in 
certain aspects whilst having similar effects in other domains (Hayakawa et al., 2007; Borgwardt et al. 
2008; Fusar-Poli et al. 2009; Winton-Brown et al. 2011; Atakan, 2012). While Δ9-THC 
characteristically produces, in a dose dependent manner, hypoactivity, hypothermia, spatial and verbal 
short-term memory impairment, CBD does not affect locomotor activity, body temperature or 
memory on its own. However, higher doses of CBD can potentiate the effects of lower doses of 
Δ9-THC by enhancing the level of CB 1 receptor expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.  
7.5.6.2.  Clinical studies 
Extracts of C. sativa,  defined in their concentrations of Δ9-THC and CBD have been administered 
orally in clinical studies. 
A medical product in the form of oral capsules is described containing a whole plant extract of 
C. sativa , with standardis ed content of Δ9-THC and a CBD concentration controlled to lie within a 
fixed narrow ran ge with a Δ9-THC:CBD ratio of about 2:1. The product has been clinically tested for 
reduction of muscle stiffness, spasms and associated pain in multiple sclerosis, for cachexia in cancer 
patients and for post-operative pain management (Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010). 
A placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted to investigate the effect of an orally administered 
standardized C. sativa  plant extract in 57 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis with poorly 
controlled spasticity. The cannabis-extract was given in capsules standardized to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC and 
0.9 mg CBD. Patients in group A started with a drug escalation phase from 15 to maximally 30 mg 
Δ9-THC by 5 mg per day if well tolerated, being on active medication for 14 days before starting 
placebo. Patients in group B started with placebo fo r 7 days, crossed to the active period (14 days) and 
closed with a 3-day placebo period (active drug dose escalation and placebo sham escalation as in 
group A). Parameters measured allowed evaluation of efficacy (e.g. spasm frequency, Ashworth 
Scale, Rivermead Mobility Index, 10 minutes timed walk) and adverse effects (self reported 
symptoms, such as dizziness, euphoria, difficulty concentrating, nausea, blurred vision, inadequate 
laughing, sleepiness) of the treatment. Seven patients discontinued the treatment. In the remaining 
50 patients, there were no statistically significant differences associated with active treatment 
compared to placebo, but trends in favour of active treatment were seen for spasm frequency, mobility 
and getting to sleep. Adverse effects during active and placebo treatment were rather similar in 
frequency but, more pronounced in severity during plant-extract treatment. The authors noted, 
however, that the generally low incidence of observed cannabinoid-related toxicity was surprising 
given the fact that 27 patients had a maintenance dose of 20 mg Δ9-THC/day or above (Vaney et al., 
2004). The CONTAM Panel noted that the data reported do not allow an evaluation of dose-response 
relationships.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 61 Killestein et al. (2002) investigated safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral Δ9-THC and C. sativa  
plant extract (standardised content of Δ9-THC; CBD concentration amounting to 20 –30 % of the 
Δ9-THC content; < 5 % other cannabinoids) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
twofold crossover study in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis who suffered from severe spasticity. 
During the first 2 weeks medication in both active treatments was adjusted to 2 daily doses of 2.5 mg 
Δ9-THC (a total of 5 mg Δ9-THC/day). If this was well tolerated the dose was raised to 5 mg Δ9-THC 
twice a day (a total of 10 mg Δ9-THC/day) for the following 2 weeks. There was a wash out period of 
4 weeks between treatments. Compared with placebo, neither Δ9-THC nor C. sativa  extract reduced 
spasticity and both acti ve treatments worsened the patients’ global impression. Total adverse events 
were more frequent after C. sativa -extract treatment (41 events) than after treatments with Δ9-THC 
(20 events) or placebo (20 events). One adverse event was described as severe acute psychosis lasting 
for five hours after the dose of the C. sativa -extract had increased. 
Zajicek et al. (2003) report on a randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre trial in which 
630 patients with stable multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity participants were treated orally for 
15 weeks with capsules containing vegetable oil as placebo (n = 213), Δ9-THC (n = 206), or C. sativa  
extract (n = 211), which contained Δ9-THC and CBD as the main cannabinoids and less than 5 % 
other cannabinoids. Capsules for active treatments were adjusted to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC per capsule, the 
daily dose being based on bodyweight and limited to a possible daily maximum dose of 25 mg 
Δ9-THC/day. The target doses of Δ9-THC were 15 mg/day for a b.w. range of 50 –69 kg and 
20 mg/day for a b.w. range of 70 –89 kg. The capsules with C. sativa  extract contained 1.25 mg CBD 
in addition to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC per capsule. Taking interindividual variation in the tolerated dose into 
account, the study started with a 5-week dose titration phase. During this period, patients were asked 
to increase their dose by one capsule (2.5 mg Δ9-THC equivalent) twice daily at weekly intervals. 
Patients were advised not to increase the dose if side-effects developed, and to reduce the dose if side-
effects were considered intolerable. Participants remained on a stable dose of medication during a 
plateau phase in weeks 6 to 13. During week 14, patients reduced their medication by one capsule 
twice daily each day until they were off study medication. Patients remained without the trial 
medication during week 15, at the end of which a final assessment was undertaken. Medication was 
stopped due to intolerable side-effects by two patients in the C. sativa  extract group, by seven patients 
in the Δ9-THC group and by none in the placebo group. There was evidence of improvement in 
spasticity/pain reported in 61 %/57 %, 60 %/50 %, and 46 %/37 % of participants on C. sativa  extract, 
Δ9-THC, and placebo, respectively. The occurrence of serious adverse events, such as multiple 
sclerosis relapse or urinary tract infection, were expected in the study population and not treatment 
related. Furthermore, the reported numbers of these adverse events were similar across the treatments, 
and slightly higher in the placebo group. Regarding so-called minor adverse events, the authors 
report ed more episodes of dizziness or light-headedness ( C. sativa  extract group: 183 events, Δ9-THC 
group: 209 events; placebo group: 53 events), and of dry mouth among the active groups ( C. sativa  
extract group: 47 events, Δ9-THC group: 60 events; placebo group: 15 events). Constipation was more 
frequent in the C. sativa  extract group (26 events, compared with nine in the Δ9-THC group and five 
in the placebo group). Diarrhoea was more common in both active groups (38 events in the C. sativa  
extract group and 36 events in the Δ9-THC group) compared with the placebo group (15 events). 
Increased appetite was a side-effect in treatment groups occurring at low levels (four in the C. sativa  
extract group, six in the Δ9-THC group, one in the placebo group). The authors noted, that most 
patients within the active treatment groups did not reach their target dose of Δ9-THC (because of side-
effects (Zajicek et al., 2003). The description of the study does not allow an analysis of the dose-
response relationships for the observed adverse effects, as does a follow up of this study in which 
patients continued medication for up to 12 months (Zajicek et al., 2005) or a substudy in which the 
potential of C. sativa  extract to reduce urge incontinence episodes in the patients were tested 
(Freeman et al., 2006). The CONTAM Panel noted that according to the study results there is no 
indication that accompanying cannabinoids present in the C. sativa  extract enhance adverse effects of 
Δ9-THC on the CNS .

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 62 In a clinical study conducted by Holdcroft et al. (2006) the potential of a single oral dose of a mixture 
of cannabinoid plant extracts to provide postoperative pain relief was investigated without placebo 
control. Pain intensity and side-effects were recorded over 6 hours. Single doses were standardised to 
5, 10 or 15 mg Δ9-THC and administe red to 11, 30 or 24 patients, respectively. Δ9-THC extract and 
CBD extract were in the ratio of 1:0.3 for the 5 mg dose group and 1:0.5 for the other groups. There 
were significant trends across the escalating dose groups for decreasing pain intensity at rest 
(p = 0.01), increasing sedation ( p = 0.03), and more adverse events ( p = 0.002). Regarding all adverse 
effects together, only 9 % of the patients of the low dose group compared to 50 % of the high dose 
group showed any adverse effect. Regarding cardiovascular adverse effects, in the 5, 10 or 15 mg 
Δ9-THC group 18, 27 or 38 % of the patients, respectively, showed a maximum increase from 
baseline heart rate which was > 20 %; 0, 3 or 8 % of the patients, respectively, showed a maximum 
decrease from baseline heart rate which was > 20 %; 0, 10 or 13 % of the patients, respectively, 
showed a maximum increase from baseline diastolic blood pressure which was > 20 %; and 9, 13 or 
25 % of the patients, respectively, showed a maximum decrease from baseline diastolic blood 
pressure which was > 20 %. Regarding CNS  adverse effects (e.g. dizziness or light-headedness, 
unpleasant mood, sleep disturbances) in the 5, 10 or 15 mg Δ9-THC group 9, 13 or 38 % of the 
patients, respectively, showed adverse effects. With respect to the low dose group (n = 11) the only 
patient, who reported an adverse CNS  effect described it as dizziness or light-headedness. Acutely 
paranoid effects occurred only in the highest dose group (n = 24) in two patients. The study was 
terminated because of a serious vasovagal adverse event (supine hypotension, pallor, bradycardia, and 
oxygen desaturation) in a patient receiving 15 mg (Holdcroft et al., 2006). The Panel noted that in 
view of the lack of placebo controls the relevance of the study results is limited, especially concerning 
subjective effects seen in the low dose group. 
7.5.7.  Intoxications associated with contamination of food 
Meier and Vonesch (1997) reported on four cases of accidental intoxications in Switzerland. After the 
consumption of a salad prepared with hemp oil containing 1 500 mg Δ9-THC/kg which significantly 
exceeds the Swiss limits of 50 mg/kg in hemp seed oil, gastrointestinal and perception disturbances 
were the prominent signs. 
7.5.8.  Biomarkers  
Urinary 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC obtained after alkaline hydrolysis to cleave the glucuronide moiety 
is monitored as a biomarker of cannabis exposure e.g. in workplace drug testing. Excretion patterns 
resulting from different consumption behaviours have been extensively studied. Following absorption 
Δ9-THC is widely distributed to adipose tissue, liver, lung, and spleen due to its lipophilicity. With 
increasing frequency and duration of cannabis use, body stores of Δ9-THC increase. After occasional 
use 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC has been detected for up to 4 days in urine. The urinary 11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC excretion lasts for several days in infrequent users and for months in frequent users. 
Thus, identification of 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC in urine may not indicate recent cannabis exposure 
(Lowe et al., 2009). 
Zuurman et al. (2009) reviewed studies aiming at the identification of biomarkers for effects of 
cannabis and Δ9-THC. 165 studies with healthy individuals published between 1966 and November 
2007 with oral, intrapulmonary or i.v. routes of exposure on cannabis or Δ9-THC met the specified 
inclusion criteria. In addition to the increase of heart rate, subjective CNS  effects, both being clearly 
dose related and already considerable at low Δ9-THC levels, were regarded to be the most reliable 
biomarkers to study the effects of cannabis/ Δ9-THC.  The  subjective effect of feeling ‘high’ 
irrespective of how it is measured, is considered to be the most sensitive CNS biomarker for the 
effects of cannabis/ Δ9-THC. Effects on motor function and memory may be used as a additional 
biomarkers when corresponding standardised tests become available.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 63 7.6. Dose response assessment 
Δ9-THC may exert both acute and long term effects, both of them being likely mediated by the main 
biological activity of the substance, i.e. its affinity as partial agonist for CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, both 
at CNS level and autonom ic nervous system level.  
The acute effects of Δ9-THC include complex effects both at the level of CNS and autonom ic nervous 
system. Available human clinical studies with oral exposure showed reversible adverse effects on 
mood (including euphoria or a feeling ‘high’), cognition, memory, and perception in a dose -related 
way single exposure to Δ9-THC. In addition Δ9-THC shows pronounced cardiovascular effects, the 
most consistent being an increased pulse rate (FDA, 2004; Hart et al., 2005; Brunton et al., 2006; 
Zuurman et al., 2009; Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010).  
Dose-related long term effects following oral exposure to Δ9-THC were observed in oral repeat dose 
studies in experimental animals and are likely secondary to the effects on the endocrine system as a 
result of the interaction of Δ9-THC with CB 1 receptor in the hypothalamus. These effects include 
decrease in b.w. and b.w. gain, changes in hormonal levels and effects on male and female 
reproductive systems, such as decreases in epididymal weights and sperm motility and increases in 
abnormal sperm, lower uterus weight, increase in oestrus cycle length. In addition, effects on immune 
system and on fetal development were observed, generally at higher doses than those at which the 
aforementioned effects were observed, or in studies performed by i.p. or i.v. administration. 
7.6.1.  Dose response data in animal studies 
The CONTAM Panel performed dose response  modeling of chronic effects of  Δ9-THC on different 
endpoints observed in the NTP studies on (NTP, 1996). The main changes described in Section 7.4.2 
were visually analysed for the presence of a monotonic dose -response relationship allowing for 
benchmark dose (BMD) response modelling. I n particular, the decreased b.w. in rats of both sexes and 
the increased length of oestrus cycle were selected for the BMD  analysis from the subchronic NTP 
study in rats. The decreased sperm motility was also analysed as supporting information since a clea r 
dose-response trend was observed although in the absence of statistically significant changes. In 
addition, the increased serum FSH and LH levels observed in male rats at the 15 -month interim 
examination of the c hronic toxicity study were also subject to  BMD analysis  
The details of the BMD calculations are reported in Appendix E. 
The calculated BMDs/BMDLs for the various selected endpoints of the NTP (1996) study are 
reported in Table 11.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 64 7.6.2.  Dose response data in humans 
The CONTAM Panel reviewed the available data on human clinical studies on Δ9-THC or extracts of 
C. sativa  containing Δ9-THC for the identification of data on dose-response relationship. Part of these 
studies have been performed in the context of investigations on the therapeutical uses of Δ9-THC or 
extracts of C. sativa  containing Δ9-THC and as such include the presence of both healthy volunteers 
and of patients under treatment. Overall, the CONTAM Panel did not identify any human studies 
suitable for the assessment of dose-response relationship. The CONTAM Panel noted also that in the 
available studies Δ9-THC effects are observed at lower doses in subjects who are cannabinoid-naïve, 
due to the tolerance developed in non-naive subjects (e.g. those using C. sativa  for recreational 
purposes). 
Overall, the CONTAM Panel identified 2.5.mg per person as the lowest observed adverse effect dose 
of Δ9-THC orally administered in a single dose study. At this dose, single exposure in healthy 
volunteers had moderate effects (increased sedation, altered scale scores in the POMS, slightly 
impaired working memory performance and reduced diastolic blood pressure) (Ballard and Wit, 2011) 
(see Section 7.5.1.3).  
Also in repeated dose studies the lowest dose of Δ9-THC orally administered to humans identified by 
the CONTAM Panel was 2.5 mg/person per day. This dose was applied in a trial for the treatment of 
anor
exia related to AIDS for a 6-week period (Beal et al., 1995) and a 12 month period (Beal et al., 
1997), and in a trial in HIV-infected patients with weight loss (Struwe et al., 1993). In these studies 
adverse effects associated with oral Δ9-THC doses of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC twice a day (5 mg Δ9-THC/day) 
or a single dose of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day were reported (see Section 7.5.1.3). 
Therefore, 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/person per day may be regarded as a lowest observed adverse effect level 
(LOAEL). Indications in fact sheets for medical uses are in accordance with this (FDA, 2004; 
Haenseler, 2014) (see Section 7.5.1.2).  
7.7. Considerations of critical effects and possibilities for derivation of a health-based 
guidance value 
From the evaluation of the results from the available human studies with oral exposure, the CONTAM 
Panel concluded that the observed CNS , as well as the increase of heart rate are both already 
considerable at low Δ9-THC levels and are both relevant for the risk assessment (see also Zuurman et 
al., 2009). Since these effects occur within a short time after administration, the CONTAM Panel 
concluded that it was appropriate to establish an ARfD for Δ9-THC. From the reported human data, 
the CONTAM Panel further concluded that adverse effects on the human CNS , such as mood 
alteration and sedation, are the most sensitive endpoints and thus, these dose-response relationships 
ar
e most suitable for the derivation of the ARfD for Δ9-THC.  
The CONTAM Panel considered the LOAEL of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC per person identified in humans for 
the derivation of the ARfD.  
Taken all together, when referring to 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day as a LOAEL in risk assessment, it has to be 
taken into account that, on the one hand, data are partly derived from individuals suffering from a 
severe impairment. On the other hand, tolerance is developing to some of the adverse effects of 
Δ9-THC, such as cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects, with repeated doses. Thus, a 
cannabinoid-naïve individual may be more susceptible to adverse effects of Δ9-THC than a subject 
after repeated dose administration and effects may be observable after a single low dose but not when 
the same dose is administered daily over an extended period.

=== PAGINA 65 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 65 The CONTAM Panel concluded that for the purpose of this risk assessment 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day, 
corresponding to 0.036 mg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. per day24 for a person with a body weight of 70 kg, may 
be regarded as the LOAEL in single and repeated uses. This is close to the LOEL of 0.04 mg THC/kg 
b.w. identified from human studies for psychotropic effects, in the scientific opinion on the safety of 
hemp ( Cannabis  genus) for use in animal feed adopted in 2011 by the EFSA FEEDAP Panel (see 
Section 1.3 for details). 
The data published since the previous EFSA evaluation in 2011 supports the identification of 2.5 mg 
Δ9-THC/day as the LOAEL. However, a NOAEL referring to the described adverse effects cannot be 
defined up to now and it is not known if these adverse effects occur below the lowest tested daily oral 
dose. The identified LOAEL of 0.036 mg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. per day is considered to be relevant for 
sensitive individuals, since it is the lowest daily dose administered in clinical studies for the 
therapeutical use of Δ9-THC.  
The CONTAM Panel concluded that an UF of 3 is sufficient to allow for extrapolation from the 
LOAEL to a NOAEL considering that the LOAEL is based on effects of low or moderate severity. An 
additional UF of 10 is required for interindividual differences because although the data on adverse 
effects are partly derived from studies in patients with severe diseases, data on adverse effects in 
infants and children are not available and there are interindividual differences in metabolism (CYP2C 
polymorphism). In the scientific opinion by the EFSA FEEDAP Panel (2011), a total UF of 100 was 
applied (see Section 1.3 for details). 
Thus, from the LOAEL of 0.036 mg/kg b.w. per day, by applying an overall UF of 30 an ARfD of 
1 μg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. (rounded to a single significant figure) is established by the CONTAM Panel. 
The data from repeated dose toxicity studies in rodents showed the presence of chronic effects of 
Δ9-THC, possibly mediated by its interaction with the endocrine system. In particular, BMD 
modelling was applied to study the dose-response relationship of the decrease in b.w. observed in the 
absence of changes in feed consumption, of changes in male and female reproductive systems and 
changes in serum hormone levels reported following subchronic or chronic oral exposure in rats. The 
CONTAM Panel identified a lowest BMDL 10 of 0.73 mg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. per day for the increased 
length in oestrus cycle as a possible chronic RP for the establishment of a TDI. Considering the 
difference of approximately 700 times between the chronic RP calculated from experimental animal 
studies and the established ARfD of 1 μg  Δ9- THC/kg b.w., the CONTAM Panel concluded that 
ensuring exposure is below the ARfD would also protect against possible effects of repeated exposure 
and therefore establishing a TDI was not necessary. 
8. Risk characterisation  
Due to the limited data on ∆9-THC in samples of animal origin, the characterisation of the acute risks 
for human health is based on the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC by means of different 
scenarios which consider the consumption of milk and dairy products resulting from the use of hemp 
seed as feed materials at the reported Δ9-THC concentrations.  
In adults, acute exposure estimations to ∆9-THC ranged between 0.0010 µg/kg b.w. and 0.029 µg/kg 
b.w
. per day. In toddlers, the respective acute exposure estimations ranged between 0.0060 µg/kg b.w. 
and 0.13 µg/kg b.w. per day. These exposure estimates are at most 3% and 13% of the ARfD of 
1 µg/kg b.w., in adults and toddlers, respectively.  
                                                 
24  According to the EFS A’s Guidance on selected default values to be used by the EFSA Scientific Committee, Scientific 
Panels and Units in the absence of actual measured data, published in 2012 (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2012) , a body 
weight of 70 kg should be used as default for the European adult population and for derived values, such as health-based 
guidance values, rounding should happen as late as possible in the assessment process.

=== PAGINA 66 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 66 The CONTAM Panel concluded that the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC by means of 
different scenarios that consider the consumption of milk and dairy products resulting from the use of 
hemp seed-derived feed materials at the reported concentrations, are unlikely to pose a health concern. 
Due to the lack of representative occurrence data for Δ9-THC in whole hemp plant-derived feed 
materials, the CONTAM Panel considered a risk assessment of dietary exposure to Δ9-THC via milk 
and dairy products, resulting from the use of these feed materials currently not feasible. Therefore, the 
C
ONTAM Panel could not conclude on the possible risks to public health from the use of whole hemp 
plant-derived feed materials for livestock. 
Due to the lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC in animal tissues and eggs, 
scenarios considering the exposure via other food of animal origin resulting from the use of hemp-
derived feed materials could not be perfo rmed. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel did not conclude on 
the possible risks to public health from the consumption of these food commodities.  
9. Uncertainty analysis 
The evaluation of the inherent uncertainties in the assessment of exposure to Δ9-THC through the 
consumption of milk has been performed following the guidance of the Opinion of the Scientific 
Committee related to Uncertainties in Dietary Exposure Assessment (EFSA, 2006). In addition, the 
report on ‘Characterizing and Communicating Uncertainty in Exposure Assessment ’ has been 
considered (WHO/IPCS, 2008). According to the guidance provided by the EFSA opinion (2006) the 
following sources of uncertainties have been considered: Assessment objectives, exposure scenario, 
exposure model, and model input (parameters). 
9.1. Assessment objectives 
The objectives of the assessment were clearly specified in the terms of reference. 
9.2. Exposure scenario/Exposure model 
Due to lack of occurrence data, an accurate estimation of the chronic and acute dietary exposure as 
requested in the terms of reference was not feasible. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel performed 
several acute exposure scenarios using reported Δ9-THC concentrations in hemp seed-derived feed 
materials, transfer rate from feed to milk, daily milk yield, daily feed consumption and human 
consumption of milk and dairy products. 
Only a few occurrence data were available for hemp seed-derived feed materials, which are far from 
bei
ng representative for respective feed commodities across Europe. Moreover, information on the 
transfer rate of ∆9-THC from feed into cow’s milk is sparse and no data could be identified in the 
peer-viewed literature. Therefore, the transfer rate used in the exposure scenarios was taken from 
information supplied to EFSA based on a study with only one cow and a non-controlled field case 
with several cows following accidental exposure from high THC containing hemp plant pellets . 
Finally, information on the fate of the precursor ∆9-THCA in the rumen of the cow and its extent of 
possible transformation into ∆9-THC, on the conversion of ∆9-THC into potentially less psychoactive 
metabolites, and the impact of processing of raw milk is lacking. The se knowledge gaps lead to a 
substantial uncertainty in the exposure estimation and the subsequent risk characterisation . 
Exposure to ∆9-THC from other food of animal origin could not be estimated due to lack of 
occurrence data and information on transfer rates. Thus, the exposure to ∆9-THC  from cow’milk and 
dairy products may underestimate the overall ∆9-THC exposure from food of animal origin.  
Furthermore, there is uncertainty about exposure to other cann abinoids (CBD and CBN), which could 
have a similar mode of action as ∆9-THC.

=== PAGINA 67 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 67 9.3. Model input (parameters) 
While the determination of ∆9-THC in hemp plants used/grown for feed has to be performed with an 
official method, which generates the sum of ∆9-THC and its precursor acids , the analysis of ∆9-THC 
in hemp derived feeding stuffs is performed with various analytical methods. Often, it is not clear 
from the reports whether the data reported as ‘THC ’ or ‘total THC ’ refer to Δ9-THC or, for example, 
to the sum of Δ9-THC plus Δ8-THC and/or plus its non-psychoactive precursors which may form 
Δ9-THC during the analytical determination or during food and feed processing.  
9.4. Other uncertainties 
The LOAEL for Δ9-THC was derived from human studies in which pure Δ9-THC was orally 
administered. The CONTAM Panel cannot exclude that active metabolites and/or co-occurring 
cannabinoids potentially being present in food commodities produced from animals that were fed with 
hemp-derived feed materials could affect the selected endpoints which were used for the derivation of 
the ARfD. This introduces some uncertainty in the value of the LOAEL. 
CBD  has been identified as the major non-psychotropic cannabinoid in C. sativa  and may reduce the 
psychoactive effects and tachycardia produced by Δ9-THC ( see Section 7.5.3 ). However, a partial 
CBD -mediated inhibition of the hydroxylation of Δ9-THC to 11- OH-Δ9-THC and the prolongation 
and/or potentiation of Δ9-THC effects have been described in a number of animal and human studies, 
the extent possibly depending on the time between the administration of the two cannabinoids and the 
dose ratio of the compounds (Zuardi et al., 2012). The mechanisms of these interactions are not fully 
understood. The concentrations in which Δ8-THC occurs in preparations of C. sativa  are said to be 
usually minuscule and not contributing substantially to their activity (Williamson and Evans, 2000; 
Izzo et al., 2009).  The ratio of potencies of Δ8-THC to Δ9-THC is considered to be approximately 2:3 
(Hollister and Gillespie, 1973). Adequate studies on interactions of Δ8- THC and Δ9-THC are lacking. 
The same holds also for Δ9-THCV, which is inducing Δ9-THC-like effects in humans with a four 
times lower potency than Δ9-THC (Hollister, 1974). Izzo et al. (2009) describe CBN  as a relatively 
minor constituent in fresh cannabis-derived material. CBN  is a product of the oxidation of Δ9-THC 
and increases in preparations when Δ9-THC degrades during storage (Williamson and Evans, 2000; 
Izzo et al., 2009). CBN  has a centrally acting effect like Δ9-THC but CBN  as well is much less potent 
than Δ9-THC (Williamson and Evans, 2000). There are also only sparse data available regarding 
possible interactions of cannabichromene (CBC) with Δ9-THC. CBC  is said to be nearly 2.5-times 
more ‘toxic ’ than Δ9-THC and, like Δ9-THC, it may cause hypothermia, sedation and hypoactivity in 
mice (Izzo et  al., 2009).  
Overall, the CONTAM Panel noted that there is a potential for additive or synergistic actions of other 
cannabinoids that may be present with Δ9-THC in food, resulting from the use of hemp-derived feed 
materials, but the extent to which they may possibly occur is uncertain. 
9.5. Summary of uncertainties 
In Table 12, a summary of the uncertainty evaluation is presented, highlighting the main sources of 
uncertainty and indicating an estimate of whether the respective source of uncertainty might have led 
to an over- or underestimation of the exposure or the resulting risk.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
CONCLUSIONS  
General 
 Tetrahydrocannabinol, more precisely delta-9-t etrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is the most 
relevant constituent of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa .  
 The hemp plant is grown principally for its fibres for industrial uses, but also as a feed for 
livestock. For feed, the seeds (either whole or after oil extraction) are used predominantly 
for exotic birds or fish. A less common practice is the use of leaves, flowers and stalks (the 
by-product of hemp production for fibres and seeds), as feed for ruminants and pigs. 
 Four stereoisomers of Δ9-THC are possible, with (-)- trans -Δ9-THC being the only naturally 
occurring stereoisomer. 
 Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, which is found in the growing and harvested plant, is 
the biosynthetic precursor of Δ9-THC. Beside 2- COOH -Δ9-THC which is termed 
Δ9-THCA-A, another positional isomer, 4-COOH- Δ9-THC, denoted Δ9-THCA-B may occur 
in the hemp plant.  
 In fresh plant material of  C. sativa , up to 90 % of the ‘total’ Δ9-THC is present as the non-
psychoactive precursor Δ9-THCA-A. 
 The rate and extent of decarboxylation of the precursor acids to Δ9-THC in the plant 
material is dependent on physical factors, in particular temperature.  
Methods of analysis 
 The method for determination of Δ9-THC in hemp plants grown for feed is prescribed by 
legislation. The official method based on capillary gas chromatography with flame 
ionisation detection (GC-FID) is not able to differentiate between Δ9-THC and its precursor 
acids. 
 Capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following liquid-

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 69 liquid extraction or solid phase microextraction is the method of choice for the 
determination of Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids in hemp-containing food products. 
 A separate determination of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids is possible by derivatization, 
such as silylation of the extract prior to gas chromatography analysis or by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
 A number of native and isotope- labelled reference standards for Δ9-THC and other 
cannabinoids are commercially available. In contrast, commercially available certified 
reference materials for food and feed containing Δ9-THC and/or other cannabinoids could 
not be identified. 
Food and feed processing 
 As high temperatures are not generated during de-hulling and oil extraction, these processes 
are not expected to result in increased levels of ∆9-THC in the oil or meal resulting from 
decarboxylation of precursor acids. 
 Although most milk is subjected to pasteurisation prior to marketing and consumption, the 
temperatures used are unlikely to result in decarboxylation of any non-psychoactive 
precursors that may be present as a result of transfer from feed.  
Occurrence 
 Initially, a total of 603 analytical results on cannabinoids were submitted to the EFSA 
database by eight different countries, 281 on food and 322 on feed.  
 Among the analytical results on food, 171 were reported as Δ9-THC, 103 as THC, four as 
cannabidiol (CBD), two as the sum of isomers of THC, and one as cannabinol (CBN). Only 
four samples of animal origin were reported, i.e. two samples of cheese and two samples 
reported as meat products. 
 Among the analytical results on feed, 230 were reported as Δ9-THC, 54 as THC and five as 
CBD . A total of 33 analytical results were excluded from the final dataset, including 
30 samples of hemp seeds intended for sowing. 
 The CONTAM Panel decided not to use the 603 available analytical results on 
cannabinoids to estimate dietary exposure to Δ9-THC. This decision was based on the fact, 
that in many cases the data represented the sum of Δ9-THC and its precursor acids since 
they were analysed by GC- MS or by GC-FID each without prior derivatization, and in other 
cases the presence of Δ9-THC was not confirmed. 
Individual data on levels of THC in hemp plants used in the EFSA FEEDAP Scientific 
Opinion (2011) were also available, together with some aggregated data on THC in hemp 
plants collected between 2009 –2012 and provided by the European Commission. As the 
data did not differentiate between Δ9-THC and its precursor acids they were not considered 
suitable for the exposure assessment. 
 At a later stage, additional analytical data on levels of different cannabinoids in food and 
feed, were provided by the European Industrial Hemp Association and the Swiss Federal 
Food Safety and Veterinary Office. These data included clearly defined levels on Δ9-THC 
in hemp seed-derived feed materials and were considered in the different scenarios used to 
carry out dietary exposure assessment.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 70 Dietary exposure to Δ9-THC  
 Acute dietary exposure to ∆9-THC was estimated combining different scenarios for the 
presence of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-derived feed materials, the transfer rate from feed to 
milk, the daily milk yield (L/cow), the daily feed consumption and the human consumption 
of milk and dairy products.  
 In adults, acute exposure estimations to ∆9-THC through the consumption of milk and dairy 
products ranged between 0.001 µg/kg body weight (b.w.) per day and 0.03 µg/kg b.w. per 
day, the latter obtained under the scenario 20 L milk yield and 11 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in 
hemp seed-derived feed materials.  
 In toddlers, acute exposure estimations to ∆9-THC through the consumption of milk and 
dairy products ranged between 0.006 µg/kg b.w. per day and 0.13 µg/kg b.w. per day, the 
latter obtained under the scenario 20 L milk yield and 11 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in hemp seed-
derived feed materials.  
 Due to the lack of ∆9-THC data on whole hemp plant-derived feed material a dietary 
exposure assessment, assuming a potential transfer of ∆9-THC from feed to milk, was not 
possible.  
 A
s pregnant women are not considered different from other population groups with respect 
to consumption of dairy products, the CONTAM Panel concluded that a separate exposure 
scenario was not needed.  
 There is substantial uncertainty associated with the exposure estimates obtained under the 
different scenarios. This uncertainty is mainly due to the limited number of available 
analytical data on ∆9-THC, and the lack of information on the fate of Δ9-THC and its 
precursor acids in the rumen of the cow and during food processing.  
 D
ietary exposure to ∆9-THC via consumption of animal tissues and eggs could not be 
estima ted, due to a lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC. 
H
azard identification and characterisation 
Toxicokinetics 
 After oral exposure, Δ9-THC is slowly and incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract. The oral bioavailability is lower compared to inhalation. 
 In humans, following oral administration of Δ9-THC, levels in plasma of the inactive 
metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC are higher and measurable for longer compared to the 
parent compound and the active metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC. Thus, 11-nor-9-carboxy-
Δ9-THC is a good indicator of the oral exposure to Δ9-THC irrespective of the source of 
Δ9-THC. 
 Δ9-THC is highly bound to plasma proteins (97 –99 %) and exhibits extensive tissue 
distribution, rapidly entering highly vascularised tissues  resulting in a quick decrease in 
plasma concentration.  
 Due to its lipophilic nature Δ9-THC is accumulated in adipose tissue and may be released 
back to other tissues including the brain.  
 Studies in both rats and humans indicate that the in vivo  conversion of ∆9-THCA-A to 
Δ9-THC does not occur.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 71  The main oxidative biotransformation pathways occur in the liver. Extrahepatic 
biotransformations resulting in hydroxylation of the pentyl side chain  have been 
documented in brain microsomes from mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits.  
 The main metabolic pathways are cytochrome P450 ( CYP )-mediated with generation of the 
psychoactive 11- OH-Δ9-THC, a further oxidation to the inactive carboxylic acid 11-nor-9-
carboxy- Δ9-THC and the glucuronidation of the parent compound and both metabolites.  
 C
YP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes are primarily involved in Δ9-THC metabolism in humans . 
Polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 enzyme have been shown to alter the kinetics of Δ9-THC.   
 Oral administration of Δ9-THC results in a higher extent of metabolism of Δ9-THC to the 
psychoactive metabolite 11- OH-Δ9-THC compared to exposure from smoking. 
 Δ9-THC and its metabolites are slowly excreted via the faeces mainly, and also in urine; an 
active entero-hepatic cycle has been described. Milk excreti on of Δ9-THC has been 
documented in humans and in a number of laboratory animals.  
  No data were identified on the fate of Δ9-THCA-A in farm animals, in particular whether or 
not it is conver ted to Δ9-THC. 
 T
he milk excretion of Δ9-THC, 11- OH-Δ9-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-THC has been 
documented in ruminants. 
 Tissue distribution in intravenous (i.v.) dosed pigs reflects that described in experimental 
animals. 
Transfer rate 
 In dairy cows, limited data indicate that the transfer rate of Δ9-THC to milk is in the range 
of 0.10 –0.15 %. No appropriate studies could be found to derive a transfer rate in to other 
animal products.  
Mode of action 
 The major effects of Δ9-THC  are mediated by the cannabinoid receptor system. The presence 
of specific polymorphisms of genes  in the endocannabinoid system (CNR1, FAAH and 
COMT Val158Met) may affect the response to Δ9-THC .  
Toxicity in experimental animals 
 Acute exposure to doses up to 3 000 and 9 000 mg  Δ9-THC/kg in dogs and monkeys, 
respectively, were not lethal. The oral LD 50 for rats and mice were 666 mg Δ9-THC/kg and 
482 mg  Δ9-THC/kg, respectively. 
 In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, fi ndings included mortality attributable to treatment 
at the high dose (500 mg/kg b.w. per day), decreases in body weight, nervous system 
effects, decreases in epididymal weights and sperm motility and increases in abnormal 
sperm, lower uterus weight and increase in oestrus cycle length. Histopathological findings 
included atrophy of the testes and ovarian and uterine hypoplasia.  
 In repeat ed dose toxicity studies in mice, decreases in body weight, nervous system effects 
lower sperm concentration, increase in oestrus cycle length, lower uterus weight, 
hyperplasia of thyroid gland follicular cells and of the forestomach were noted.

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 72  Δ9-THC exposure affects various components of the immune system in mice, i.e. natural 
killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells. Resistance to influenza virus was shown to be 
affected. Perinatal exposure of mice to Δ9-THC caused fetal thymic atrophy and T cell 
dysfunction, postnatally. 
 There is no evidence of teratogenicity following exposure to Δ9-THC in rodent studies. 
Other findings from reproduction studies in rats and mice include decreases in the number 
of viable pups, an increase in fetal mortality and early resorptions, in the presence of 
maternal toxicity. 
 Δ9-THC and other cannabinoids may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis mainly 
via the interaction with cannabinoid receptor CB 1 found in the hypothalamus, mainly 
resulting in a depression of the reproductive hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone. 
 The major neurotoxic effects of Δ9-THC in experimental animals include alterations in 
locomotor activity, reduced social interactions and impaired learning. These behavioural 
alterations have been observed following acute or chronic administration of Δ9-THC, and in 
adult animals that were exposed to Δ9-THC during development.  
 The developing brain appears to be sensitive to Δ9-THC at doses that have no adverse 
effects in the adult brain (1 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)). 
 Although Δ9-THC has shown some limited effects on DNA damage in vitro , the available 
evidence indicate that it is not genotoxic in vivo . 
 There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of ∆9-THC in male and female mice 
based on increased incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas at 125 mg/kg b.w. 
per day. 
Human pharmacological and toxicological data 
 In a healthy volunteer study, a single dose of 2.5 mg Δ9-THC per person resulted in 
moderate effects consisting of increased sedation, altered scale scores in the Profile of 
Mood States, slightly impaired working memory performance and reduced diastolic blood 
pressure. 
 In repeated dose clinical studies investigating the efficacy and safety of orally administered 
Δ9-THC in the treatment of appetite loss or anorexia related to HIV, adverse events 
af
fecting the nervous system, (such as euphoria, mood altering effects dizziness, thinking 
abnormalities, somnolence and sedation) and tachycardia were observed at doses of 2.5 and 
5 mg Δ9-THC/day.  
 Effects on the cardiovascular system, have been shown to occur following administration of 
Δ9-THC, the most consistent being an increased pulse rate. 
 T
he CONTAM Panel noted that there is a potential for additive or synergistic actions of 
other cannabinoids that may be present together with Δ9-THC in food, resulting from the 
use of hemp-derived feed material, but the extent to which they may possibly occur is 
uncertain.  
Dose response assessment 
 Studies in humans indicated that 2.5 mg Δ9-THC/day, corresponding to 0.036 mg 
Δ9-THC/kg b.w. per day for a person with a body weight of 70 kg, may be regarded as a 
lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL), at which not only appetite is stimulated but

=== PAGINA 73 ===

 Tetrahydrocannabinol in milk and other food  of animal origin  
 
EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 73 also adverse central nervous system adverse effects may occur. It is also the lowest dose 
known to exhibit moderate adverse effects in single dose studies in healthy volunteers. 
Health-based guidance value 
 From the LOAEL of 0.036 mg/kg b.w. per day in humans an acute reference dose (ARfD) 
of 1 μg Δ9-THC/kg b.w. is established by applying an overall uncertainty factor (UF) of 30. 
This UF takes into account extrapolation of a no observed adverse effect level from the 
LOAEL (factor of 3) and interindividual differences (factor of 10).  
 The derivation of a Tolerable Daily Intake was not considered to be necessary because 
ensuring that the exposure is below the ARfD would also protect against possible effects of 
repeated exposure. 
Risk characterisation  
 Due to the limited data on ∆9-THC in samples of animal origin, the characterisation of the 
acute risks for human health is based on the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC by 
means of different scenarios, that consider the consumption of milk and dairy products 
resulting from the use of hemp seed as feed materials at the reported Δ9-THC concentrations   
 These exposure estimates are at the most 3 % and 13 % of the ARfD of 1 µg/kg b.w. in adults 
and toddlers, respectively.  
 The CONTAM Panel concluded that the estimates of dietary exposure to ∆9-THC, by means 
of different scenarios that consider the consumption of milk and dairy products resulting from 
the use of hemp seed-derived feed materials at the reported concentrations, are unlikely to 
pose a health concern. 
 Due to the lack of representative occurrence data for Δ9-THC in whole hemp plant-derived 
feed materials, the CONTAM Panel considered a risk assessment of dietary exposure to 
Δ9-THC via milk and dairy products, resulting from the use of these feed materials currently 
not feasible. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel could not conclude on the possible risks to 
public health from the use of whole hemp plant-derived feed materials for livestock.   
 Due to the lack of data on the potential transfer and fate of ∆9-THC in animal tissues and 
eggs, scenarios considering the exposure via other food of animal origin resulting from the 
use of hemp-derived feed materials could not be performed. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel 
did not conclude on the possible risks to public health from the consumption of these food 
commodities.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
 Analytical methods for the analysis of hemp plants and hemp-derived products should be 
implemented to differentiate between the psychoactive compound Δ9-THC and their non-
psychoactive precursor acids. 
 Data on occurrence of Δ9-THC, its precursors and other cannabinoids in hemp-derived feed 
m
aterials for food producing livestock are needed. 
 Further studies on the transfer rate of Δ9-THC, its metabolites, as well as other cannabinoids , 
and in particular on those that are known to be psychoactive, into animal products intended 
for human consumption are needed.

producing animals, especially ruminants, and in food processing. 
 Data on occurrence of cannabinoids in food, in particular on those that are known to be 
psychoactive, and those that have the potential to interact with Δ9- THC are needed.

E1.  Benchmark dose modelling of the changes in length of oestrus cycle 
The data on the changes in the length of the oestrus cycle observed in the rat subchronic NTP (1996) 
study were used for the BMD modelling. 
BMDL was calculated by means of the software PROAST38.9 (RIVM). The nested models for 
continuous data were selected for the analysis. Although the default BMR for continuous data would 
be 5 %, as advised by the EFSA guidance on the use of the BMD (EFSA, 2009), the BMR was 
selected at 10 % (95 % confidence level) since it was noted that such change would have fallen within 
t
he range of the standard error of the mean oestrus cycle for the control group. The results obtained 
with a BMR of 5 % are reported for transparency reasons.

EFSA Journal 20 15;13(6):4141 114 E3. Benchmark dose modelling of the changes in body weights 
The data on the decreased body weight observed in the rat subchronic NTP (1996) study were used for 
the BMD modelling. 
BMDL was calculated by means of the software PROAST38.9 (RIVM). The nested models for 
continuous data were selected for the analysis. Although the default BMR for continuous data would 
be 5 %, as advised by the EFSA guidance on the use of the BMD (EFSA, 2009), the BMR was set at 
10 % (95 % confidence level), based on toxicological evaluation related to the limited biological 
relevance of a 5 % decrease in b.w. The results obtained with the BMR of 5 % were also reported for 
transparency reasons. Modelling was performed for males and females using sex as covariate. Th e 
results showed significantly lower BMD(L)s for males, therefore the calculation was performed again 
using only data for male rats.

The data on hormonal changes were studied in male rats during at the interim 15 months period of the 
rat chronic NTP (1996) study. Visual analysis of the data showed clear dose response for increases in 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). 
BMDL was calculated by means of the software PROAST38.9 (RIVM). The nested models for 
continuous data were selected for the analysis. The default BMR of 5 % (95 % confidence level) for 
continuous data was applied ad advised by the EFSA guidance on the use of the BMD (EFSA, 2009). 
Calculations using BMR of 10 % were also performed.
