EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM FOR EUROPEAN UNION LEGISLATION WITHIN
THE SCOPE OF THE UK/EU WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT AND THE WINDSOR
FRAMEWORK
COM (2025) 553 FINAL
PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF
THE COUNCIL AMENDING REGULATION (EU) NO 1308/2013 AS REGARDS THE
SCHOOL FRUIT, VEGETABLES AND MILK SCHEME (‘EU SCHOOL SCHEME’),
SECTORAL INTERVENTIONS, THE CREATION OF A PROTEIN SECTOR,
REQUIREMENTS FOR HEMP, THE POSSIBILITY FOR MARKETING STANDARDS
FOR CHEESE, PROTEIN CROPS AND MEAT, APPLICATION OF ADDITIONAL
IMPORT DUTIES, RULES ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES IN TIME OF
EMERGENCIES AND SEVERE CRISIS AND SECURITIES
Submitted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 21st January
2026
SUBJECT MATTER
1. The European Commission is proposing a simpler, more targeted and future-
oriented Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for post-2027. Specifically, Regulation
1308/2013, more commonly known as the Common Market Organisation (CMO), is
being revised to reflect changes in the agricultural sector.
2. Many of the proposed amendments do not fall within the sections of the CMO that
are applicable to Northern Ireland (NI) under Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework
and therefore will not be covered further in this Explanatory Memorandum. This
includes amendments linked to promoting healthy eating through locally sourced
products via the European Union (EU) School schemes, rules on sectoral
interventions, and improving the preparedness and availability of agricultural
supplies during emergencies.
3. Some of the amendments to the CMO are technical changes to incorporate certain
rules and empowerments currently set out in Regulation 2021/2116 regarding
control and monitoring provisions for public intervention and aid for private storage,
tariff quotas, recognition of producer organisations and securities. The CMO is also
amended to update provisions on calculating additional import duties to align with
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture.
4. However, amendments that fall under Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework and
represent a change in policy that could have a potential impact on NI, fall into three
Page 2 of 14
categories: marketing standards expansion, broader hemp import rules, and new
restricted meat terms.
5. The CMO is amended to enable the creation of Marketing Standards for protein
crops (such as dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean), beef, pigmeat,
sheepmeat, goatmeat, and cheese. ‘Marketing Standards’ refer to sector-specific
regulations including those which establish definitions, minimum product standards,
production methods, sales descriptions, product categories, and labelling
requirements for a range of agricultural products. These standards currently cover
fruit and vegetables, hops, wine, beef and veal, eggs for eating, hatching eggs and
chicks, olive oil and olives, poultrymeat, live plants and spreadable fats.
6. The CMO is also amended to expand the hemp products (i.e. products derived from
low-THC cannabis plants) that can be imported and/or marketed in the Union -  in
addition to raw true hemp, and hemp seeds for sowing/not for sowing -  it will include
other parts of the hemp plant falling under CN code 1211 90 86 including the flowers
and leaves of the cannabis plant, which are controlled drugs under domestic United
Kingdom (UK) legislation. Imports and domestic production in the European Union
and Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to the specific conditions on
maximum tetrahydrocannabinol (0.3% THC) levels being met. Under the proposed
amendment, a derogation will be in place to enable the import of non-compliant
products imported for use for medical and scientific purposes in accordance with
Union, international and national law. The intention of the proposals is to increase
the utilisation of the full hemp plant to maximise the value of the crop and to
encourage growth in the EU hemp sector.
7. Finally, the CMO is amended to provide a new legal definition of “meat” and “meat
products” to help customers make informed choices. These definitions align with
existing food information and hygiene regulations (Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011
and Regulation (EC) No 853/2004). Additionally, certain meat-related terms are
restricted (listed in Annex B) and may only be used for food products derived
exclusively from meat (‘the edible parts of an animal’) or composite products where
no non-meat part takes the place of any meat constituent. Notably, common terms
such as ‘steak’, ‘burger’, and ‘sausage’ are not listed.
SCRUTINY HISTORY
8. The Parliamentary scrutiny history relevant to this Explanatory Memorandum is
contained in the attached Annex A.
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Page 3 of 14
9. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has responsibility
for this policy area.
10. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has responsibility in relation to
UK Drug laws.
INTEREST OF THE DEVOLVED GOVERNMENTS (DGs)
11. The devolved Governments have been consulted in the preparation of this
Explanatory Memorandum, and their views have been included in it. Scottish and
Welsh Governments and the NI Executive are responsible for policymaking in their
respective nations with proposed amendments relating to marketing standards and
hemp representing devolved policy areas, and subject to the Agricultural Support
Provisional Common Framework. It should be noted that NI has separate
competence for domestic policy on cannabis cultivation (including hemp
cultivation). However, the UK Government retains policy responsibility for the
import and export of controlled drugs.
LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL ISSUES
12.
i. Application of the Windsor Framework
The NI Assembly conducts democratic scrutiny of relevant regulations under
the terms of schedule 6B of the NI Act 1998.
The terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and the Windsor
Framework provide that limited areas of EU law will apply in the UK in
respect of NI. Only parts of Regulation No 1308/2013 (the CMO) are
applicable in NI under the Windsor Framework. The parts listed under Annex
2 of the Windsor Framework are as follows:
-  Section 1 of Chapter I of Title II of Part II (under 31 - Food – ingredients,
traces, residues, marketing standards)
-
Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter I of Title II of Part II (under 45 - Intellectual
property)
-  Part III (under 47 - Other)
Article 13(3) of the Windsor Framework confirms that a reference to Union
Legislation is a reference to that legislation as amended or replaced. This
proposed regulation will amend or replace provisions in the CMO
Regulation. Some of these changes are to provisions listed in Annex 2 of
the Windsor Framework which will apply to NI under the Withdrawal
Agreement and Windsor Framework.
Page 4 of 14
ii. EU Legal Base
The legal basis for this proposal is the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU,
and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof.
iii. Voting Procedure
Ordinary legislative procedure
iv. Timetable for adoption and implementation
The amendments are at the proposal stage and there is no detailed
information about implementation timetables, other than the EU proposes
to defer the date of application for:
-
Amendments related to conditions for the marketing, production and
import of hemp, until the 1 January after the date of entry into force;
-
Amendments related to meat-related terms in the newly inserted Part
1a of Annex VII, by a year.
This is to allow member states and operators sufficient time to comply with
the new rules.
POLICY AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS
Marketing standards
13. This proposal adds protein crops, beef, pigmeat, sheepmeat, goatmeat and cheese
to the list of sectors and products in Article 75 for which Marketing Standards may
apply. These amendments do not alter the regulatory position of these goods at
present. Marketing standards vary between products and, if introduced in the
future, their specifics would be outlined in delegated and implementing acts. Any
changes would be expected to improve consumer information and contribute to
improving the economic conditions for the production and marketing, and the
quality of the above products. The Government’s assessment on the impact of any
changes could only be carried out upon publication of these additional acts.
14. The proposal also makes a minor amendment to point (j) of Article 75(3) so that
Marketing Standards may cover ‘the place of farming and/or origin’ with no
exclusion for poultrymeat and spreadable fats intended for human consumption. At
present, poultrymeat and spreadable fats are excluded from this requirement.
While this represents a change to the current legislation, the Government’s
assessment is that the impact on NI would be low.
Hemp
15. This proposal amends Article 189, to expand the hemp products which can be
imported and/or marketed in the Union.  In addition to raw true hemp under CN
Page 5 of 14
code 5302, and hemp seeds for sowing/not for sowing, it will include other parts of
the hemp plant falling under CN code 1211 90 86.  This is to ensure that all parts
of the hemp plant are considered ‘agricultural products’ and to align with the
addition of these ‘other’ hemp products to the eligibility criteria for their EU
production and marketing, to ensure consistency. The Commission aims to
increase the utilisation of the full hemp plant, to maximise the value of the crop,
and to encourage growth in the EU hemp sector.
16. The THC content of raw hemp, hemp seeds for sowing, and ‘other’ parts of the
plant will continue to be subject to the specific conditions on maximum
tetrahydrocannabinol (0.3% THC) levels being met. The maximum THC level of
0.3% already currently applies in NI, this is different from that which applies in Great
Britain (GB) (0.2%). This follows amendments already made by the EU in 2021,
following the most up to date scientific evidence on the risk to human health.
17. A derogation is included to enable the importation of non-compliant products (i.e.
THC >0.3%) for medical or scientific use, which is covered by other drug-related
legislation and in accordance with EU, international, and national laws.
18. We consider that this change is likely to be a replacement of articles covered by
Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework for the purposes of Article 13(3) of the Windsor
Framework. This change would replace Article 189 but with the same overall
objective of specifying the hemp products and the applicable conditions for such
products to be imported into the Union.
19. It should be noted that Cannabis is a Class B controlled drug under the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971 (MDA 1971).  Cannabis is defined in section 37(1) of the MDA 1971
and is, in essence, any plant of the genus ‘cannabis’ (which includes the hemp
plant) or any part of the plant with limited exceptions (the exceptions are the mature
stalk; fibre produced from the mature stalk; or the seed of any such plant).
Cannabis is also listed in Schedule 1 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001
(MDR 2001) and as such, it is unlawful to possess, supply, offer to supply, produce,
import or export this drug except under a Home Office licence.
20. The flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant (which includes the ‘hemp’ plant) are
therefore Class B controlled drugs under UK legislation irrespective of THC
content.  They cannot ordinarily be possessed except under a Home Office
controlled drugs licence.
21. Higher THC cannabis products can be imported to the UK under licence, if there is
a lawful purpose. This includes both, schedule 1 Cannabis, and cannabis-based
products for medicinal use (CBPMs) (which are placed in Schedule 2 to the MDR
2001 and are therefore available for prescribing for human use, with special
conditions).
Page 6 of 14
22. While this proposal will permit the importation of other parts of the hemp plant with
THC ≤0.3%; and shows no distinction between raw true hemp, hemp seeds and
other parts of the plant for agricultural purposes (e.g. eligibility for area-based
payments); domestic UK law for controlled drugs still draws a distinction. Under UK
law the other parts of the plant, such as flowers and leaves, are still controlled
substances, regardless of THC content, and would continue to need an associated
licence from the Home Office.
23. However, the current version of Article 189 specifically provides for Member States
to apply these more restrictive rules, in compliance with the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU and the obligations under the WTO Agreement on
Agriculture.  There does not appear to be a similar provision as part of the proposed
changes, which could have an impact on current domestic hemp policy.
24. The Government’s assessment is that the changes would have a low impact on NI
importers as there are limited changes of substance compared with existing
measures and most hemp imports into NI originate within the EU.  The maximum
THC level of 0.3% that currently applies in NI is a regulatory divergence from
existing GB policy (0.2% THC). However, the Government is working to increase
the legal limits of THC content to 0.3% following recommendation from the Advisory
Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD).
Meat Terms
25. The proposed regulations add pigmeat, sheepmeat and goatmeat to the list of
sectors or products in Article 78 for which the definitions, designations and sales
descriptions provided for in Annex VII apply. Article 78 also specifies that the
definitions, designations and sales descriptions in Annex VII may only be used in
the Union for the marketing of a product which meets the requirements of that
Annex (these rules appear to apply to any product even if it is not listed or otherwise
covered by the list of products/sectors in Article 78).
26. Alongside this, the proposed regulations insert a new part 1a to Annex VII that
includes a new definition of “meat” as “exclusively the edible parts of an animal”
and sets out rules on the designations of “meat” and “meat products” (defined as
“products derived exclusively from meat” although substances necessary for their
manufacture may be added provided they are not used for the purpose of taking
the place of any meat constituent). New part 1a reserves certain meat terms such
as Beef, Chicken, and Bacon (full list in Annex B) for products derived exclusively
from meat at all stages of marketing. The recitals to the proposed regulation
indicate that this amendment is intended to protect meat-related terms which have
‘cultural and historical significance’ as well as enhancing transparency in terms of
Page 7 of 14
food composition and nutritional content, allowing consumers to make informed
choices. The Government’s assessment is that goods moving from NI to GB would
be unaffected. These rules would not apply to goods moving from GB to NI under
the Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme (NIRMS), provided that they comply
with the conditions of NIRMS, including not-for-EU labelling to ensure goods do not
go on to enter the EU market. These changes would apply to goods moving from
GB to NI outside NIRMS and internally in NI (for goods manufactured in NI for its
own market, or products intended for the EU market); meat-free products could still
be sold, but manufacturers would be required to change the packaging or
marketing terminology on their products to comply with this amendment. Whilst
there are not currently restrictions in assimilated legislation which explicitly
prescribe how meat terms may be used, existing laws already prohibit misleading
food descriptions, so this proposal may, in some cases, simply clarify rather than
significantly change current practice.
Miscellaneous:
27. The proposed regulations also make amendments to specified Commission
powers in the CMO (relevant to the Windsor Framework, powers to adopt
implementing acts in Articles 116, 179, 183, and 193a(2)) which disapply the
procedures at Articles 229(2) and (3) concerning the role of the Committee for the
Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets in exercising these powers. The
amendments indicate that the procedure specified in Article 229(4) (a new
provision also proposed to be inserted which relates to the “advisory procedure” in
Regulation 182/2011) also does not apply.  Article 229 of the CMO does not fall
under Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework. Therefore, the Government’s
assessment is that this amendment will not have an impact in NI.
28. This proposal makes a minor technical amendment to Article 90a which is the
provision on the duty of member states to apply proportionate, effective and
dissuasive administrative penalties in the event of an infringement on union rules
in the wine sector. The Government’s assessment is that this change in referencing
will have no impact on business or consumers in NI.
29. The proposal makes a minor amendment to Article 182 on trigger volumes to align
with the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.  It also makes it easier to apply additional
duties by removing the prohibition on imposing additional duties where the imports
are unlikely to disturb the Union market or where the effects would be
disproportionate to the intended objective. The Government’s assessment is that
these changes would have limited impact on NI importers bringing in non-GB/EU
goods that would remain in NI, compared with the current position, given the minor
nature of the changes. There would be no impact on GB goods moving to NI or
vice-versa.
Page 8 of 14
30. The proposal amends Article 186(1) which empowers the Commission to adopt
delegated acts to ensure fair access and equal treatment within a tariff quota. The
amendment provides for penalties to be applied, via delegated acts, to operators
where they fail to comply with the necessary tariff quota provisions or fail to provide
accurate information to licensing authorities. The Government’s assessment is that
this will have no impact on NI importers as they are not permitted access to EU
tariff quotas and will not create any divergence with GB.
CONSULTATION
31. No formal consultation has taken place across the UK at this stage. Introduction of
the EU amendments is expected to follow the ordinary co-legislative process by
the European Parliament and Council. No timeline for that procedure has been set
out at present, but the EU proposes to defer the application of the rules related to
conditions for the marketing, production and imports of hemp until the 1 January
after the date of entry into force and rules on meat-related terms by a year. This is
to allow member states and operators sufficient time to comply with the new rules.
32. The proposal is part of the review of the CAP for post-2027 for which an overall
impact assessment and stakeholder consultations were carried out by the
European Commission.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
33. Our initial assessments suggest that the proposed legislative measures have no
budgetary implications for the UK Government.
34. There may be costs to industry in terms of labelling changes. This could include
the addition of not-for-EU labelling on goods moving from GB to NI under NIRMS
and changes to packaging and marketing terminology by manufacturers producing
goods for the NI market or the EU market, in order to comply with the amendment
regarding meat-terms.
