DIRECTIVE 2014/40/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 3 April 2014
on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States
concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing
Directive 2001/37/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 53(1), 62 and 114
thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ),
Whereas:
(1)
Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) lays down rules at Union level concerning
tobacco products. In order to reflect scientific, market and international developments, substantial changes to that
Directive would be needed and it should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Directive.
(2)
In its reports of 2005 and 2007 on the application of Directive 2001/37/EC the Commission identified areas in
which further action was considered useful for the smooth functioning of the internal market. In 2008 and 2010
the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) provided scientific advice to
the Commission on smokeless tobacco products and tobacco additives. In 2010 a broad stakeholder consultation
took place, which was followed by targeted stakeholder consultations and accompanied by studies by external
consultants. Member States were consulted throughout the process. The European Parliament and the Council
repeatedly called on the Commission to review and update Directive 2001/37/EC.
(3)
In certain areas covered by Directive 2001/37/EC, Member States are legally or in practice prevented from effec­
tively adapting their legislation to new developments. This is in particular relevant for the labelling rules, where
Member States have not been permitted to increase the size of the health warnings, change their location on an
individual packet (‘unit packet’) or replace misleading warnings on the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (TNCO)
emission levels.

( 4 ) Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations
and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (OJ
L 194, 18.7.2001, p. 26).

(4)
In other areas there are still substantial differences between the Member States' laws, regulations and administrative
provisions on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products which present obstacles to
the smooth functioning of the internal market. In the light of scientific, market and international developments
these discrepancies are expected to increase. This also applies to electronic cigarettes and refill containers for
electronic cigarettes (‘refill containers’), herbal products for smoking, ingredients and emissions from tobacco
products, certain aspects of labelling and packaging and to cross-border distance sales of tobacco products.
(5)
Those obstacles should be eliminated and, to this end, the rules on the manufacture, presentation and sale of
tobacco and related products should be further approximated.
(6)
The size of the internal market in tobacco and related products, the increasing tendency of manufacturers of
tobacco products to concentrate production for the entire Union in only a small number of production plants
within the Union and the resulting significant cross-border trade of tobacco and related products calls for stronger
legislative action at Union rather than national level to achieve the smooth functioning of the internal market.
(7)
Legislative action at Union level is also necessary in order to implement the WHO Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (‘FCTC’) of May 2003, the provisions of which are binding on the Union and its Member States.
The FCTC provisions on the regulation of the contents of tobacco products, the regulation of tobacco product
disclosures, the packaging and labelling of tobacco products, advertising and illicit trade in tobacco products are
particularly relevant. The Parties to the FCTC, including the Union and its Member States, adopted a set of
guidelines for the implementation of FCTC provisions by consensus during various Conferences.
(8)
In accordance with Article 114(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), a high level of
health protection should be taken as a base for legislative proposals and, in particular, any new developments
based on scientific facts should be taken into account. Tobacco products are not ordinary commodities and in view
of the particularly harmful effects of tobacco on human health, health protection should be given high importance,
in particular, to reduce smoking prevalence among young people.
(9)
It is necessary to establish a number of new definitions in order to ensure that this Directive is uniformly applied
by Member States. Where different obligations imposed by this Directive apply to different product categories and
the relevant product falls into more than one of those categories (e.g. pipe, roll your-own tobacco), the stricter
obligations should apply.
(10)
Directive 2001/37/EC established maximum limits for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes that
should also be applicable to cigarettes which are exported from the Union. Those maximum limits and that
approach remain valid.
(11)
For measuring the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes (hereinafter referred to as ‘emission
levels’), reference should be made to the relevant, internationally recognised ISO standards. The verification process
should be protected from tobacco industry influence by using independent laboratories, including State labora­
tories. Member States should be able to use laboratories situated in other Member States of the Union. For other
emissions from tobacco products, there are no internationally agreed standards or tests for quantifying maximum
levels. The ongoing efforts at international level to develop such standards or tests should be encouraged.
(12)
As regards establishing maximum emission levels, it could be necessary and appropriate at a later date to reduce
the emission levels for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide or to establish maximum levels for other emissions from
tobacco products, taking into consideration their toxicity or addictiveness.

(13)
In order to carry out their regulatory tasks, Member States and the Commission require comprehensive
information on the ingredients and emissions from tobacco products to assess the attractiveness, addictiveness
and toxicity of tobacco products and the health risks associated with the consumption of such products. To this
end, the existing reporting obligations for ingredients and emissions should be strengthened. Additional enhanced
reporting obligations should be provided for in respect of additives included in a priority list in order to assess,
inter alia their toxicity, addictiveness and carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic properties (‘CMR properties’),
including in combusted form. The burden of such enhanced reporting obligations for SMEs should be limited
to the extent possible. Such reporting obligations are consistent with the obligation placed on the Union to ensure
a high level of protection for human health.
(14)
The use of differing reporting formats, as is currently the case, makes it difficult for manufacturers and importers
to fulfil their reporting obligations and burdensome for the Member States and the Commission to compare,
analyse and draw conclusions from the information received. Therefore, there should be a common mandatory
format for the reporting of ingredients and emissions. The greatest possible transparency of product information
should be ensured for the general public, whilst ensuring that appropriate account is taken of the trade secrets of
the manufacturers of tobacco products. Existing systems for the reporting of ingredients should be taken into
account.
(15)
The lack of a harmonised approach to regulating the ingredients of tobacco products affects the smooth func­
tioning of the internal market and has a negative impact on the free movement of goods across the Union. Some
Member States have adopted legislation or entered into binding agreements with the industry allowing or
prohibiting certain ingredients. As a result, some ingredients are regulated in certain Member States, but not in
others. Member States also take differing approaches as regards additives in the filters of cigarettes as well as
additives colouring the tobacco smoke. Without harmonisation, the obstacles to the smooth functioning of the
internal market are expected to increase in the coming years, taking into account the implementation of the FCTC
and the relevant FCTC guidelines throughout the Union and in the light of experience gained in other jurisdictions
outside the Union. The FCTC guidelines in relation to the regulation of the contents of tobacco products and
regulation of tobacco product disclosures call in particular for the removal of ingredients that increase palatability,
create the impression that tobacco products have health benefits, are associated with energy and vitality or have
colouring properties.
(16)
The likelihood of diverging regulation is further increased by concerns over tobacco products having a char­
acterising flavour other than one of tobacco, which could facilitate initiation of tobacco consumption or affect
consumption patterns. Measures introducing unjustified differences of treatment between different types of
flavoured cigarettes should be avoided. However, products with characterising flavour with a higher sales
volume should be phased out over an extended time period to allow consumers adequate time to switch to
other products.
(17)
The prohibition of tobacco products with characterising flavours does not preclude the use of individual additives
outright, but it does oblige manufacturers to reduce the additive or the combination of additives to such an extent
that the additives no longer result in a characterising flavour. The use of additives necessary for the manufacture of
tobacco products, for example sugar to replace sugar that is lost during the curing process, should be allowed, as
long as they do not result in a characterising flavour or increase the addictiveness, toxicity or CMR properties of
the product. An independent European advisory panel should assist in such decision making. The application of
this Directive should not lead to discrimination between different tobacco varieties, nor should it prevent product
differentiation.
(18)
Certain additives are used to create the impression that tobacco products have health benefits, present reduced
health risks or increase mental alertness and physical performance. These additives, as well as additives that have
CMR properties in unburnt form, should be prohibited in order to ensure uniform rules throughout the Union and
a high level of protection of human health. Additives that increase addictiveness and toxicity should also be
prohibited.

(19)
Considering this Directive's focus on young people, tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own
tobacco, should be granted an exemption from certain requirements relating to ingredients as long as there is no
substantial change of circumstances in terms of sales volumes or consumption patterns of young people.
(20)
Given the general prohibition of the sale of tobacco for oral use in the Union, the responsibility for regulating the
ingredients of tobacco for oral use, which requires in-depth knowledge of the specific characteristics of this product
and of its patterns of consumption, should, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, remain with Sweden,
where the sale of this product is permitted pursuant to Article 151 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and
Sweden.
(21)
In line with the purposes of this Directive, namely to facilitate the smooth functioning of the internal market for
tobacco and related products, taking as a base a high level of health protection, especially for young people, and in
line with Council Recommendation 2003/54/EC ( 1 ), Member States should be encouraged to prevent sales of such
products to children and adolescents, by adopting appropriate measures that lay down and enforce age limits.
(22)
Disparities still exist between national provisions regarding the labelling of tobacco products, in particular with
regard to the use of combined health warnings consisting of a picture and a text, information on cessation services
and promotional elements in and on unit packets.
(23)
Such disparities are liable to constitute a barrier to trade and to impede the smooth functioning of the internal
market in tobacco products, and should, therefore, be eliminated. Also, it is possible that consumers in some
Member States are better informed about the health risks of tobacco products than consumers in other Member
States. Without further action at Union level, the existing disparities are likely to increase in the coming years.
(24)
Adaptation of the provisions on labelling is also necessary to align the rules that apply at Union level to inter­
national developments. For example, the FCTC guidelines on the packaging and labelling of tobacco products call
for large picture warnings on both principal display areas, mandatory cessation information and strict rules on
misleading information. The provisions on misleading information will complement the general ban on misleading
business to consumer commercial practices laid down in Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council ( 2 ).
Member States that use tax stamps or national identification marks for fiscal purposes on the packaging of tobacco
products may, in some cases, have to provide for these stamps and marks to be repositioned in order to allow for
the combined health warnings to be at the top of the principal display areas, in line with this Directive and the
FCTC guidelines. Transitional arrangements should be put in place to allow Member States to maintain tax stamps
or national identification marks used for fiscal purposes at the top of unit packets for a certain period after
transposition of this Directive.
(25)
The labelling provisions should also be adapted to new scientific evidence. For example, the indication of the
emission levels for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide on unit packets of cigarettes has proven to be misleading as
it leads consumers to believe that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others. Evidence also suggests that large
combined health warnings comprised of a text warning and a corresponding colour photograph are more effective
than warnings consisting only of text. As a consequence, combined health warnings should become mandatory
throughout the Union and cover significant and visible parts of the surface of unit packets. Minimum dimensions
should be set for all health warnings to ensure their visibility and effectiveness.

2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and
of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) (OJ L 149, 11.6.2005, p. 22).

(26)
For tobacco products for smoking, other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products, which are mainly
consumed by older consumers and small groups of the population, it should be possible to continue to grant an
exemption from certain labelling requirements as long as there is no substantial change of circumstances in terms
of sales volumes or consumption patterns of young people. The labelling of these other tobacco products should
follow rules that are specific to them. The visibility of health warnings on smokeless tobacco products should be
ensured. Health warnings should, therefore, be placed on the two main surfaces of the packaging of smokeless
tobacco products. As regards waterpipe tobacco, which is often perceived as less harmful than traditional tobacco
products for smoking, the full labelling regime should apply in order to avoid consumers being misled.
(27)
Tobacco products or their packaging could mislead consumers, in particular young people, where they suggest that
these products are less harmful. This is, for example, the case if certain words or features are used, such as the
words ‘low-tar’, ‘light’, ‘ultra-light’, ‘mild’, ‘natural’, ‘organic’, ‘without additives’, ‘without flavours’ or ‘slim’, or
certain names, pictures, and figurative or other signs. Other misleading elements might include, but are not
limited to, inserts or other additional material such as adhesive labels, stickers, onserts, scratch-offs and sleeves
or relate to the shape of the tobacco product itself. Certain packaging and tobacco products could also mislead
consumers by suggesting benefits in terms of weight loss, sex appeal, social status, social life or qualities such as
femininity, masculinity or elegance. Likewise, the size and appearance of individual cigarettes could mislead
consumers by creating the impression that they are less harmful. Neither the unit packets of tobacco products
nor their outside packaging should include printed vouchers, discount offers, reference to free distribution, two-for-
one or other similar offers that could suggest economic advantages to consumers thereby inciting them to buy
those tobacco products.
(28)
In order to ensure the integrity and the visibility of health warnings and maximise their efficacy, provisions should
be made regarding the dimensions of the health warnings as well as regarding certain aspects of the appearance of
the unit packets of tobacco products, including the shape and opening mechanism. When prescribing a cuboid
shape for a unit packet, rounded or bevelled edges should be considered acceptable, provided the health warning
covers a surface area that is equivalent to that on a unit packet without such edges. Member States apply different
rules on the minimum number of cigarettes per unit packet. Those rules should be aligned in order to ensure free
circulation of the products concerned.
(29)
Considerable volumes of illicit products, which do not fulfil the requirements laid down in Directive 2001/37/EC,
are placed on the market and there are indications that these volumes might increase. Such illicit products
undermine the free circulation of compliant products and the protection provided for by tobacco control legis­
lation. In addition, the FCTC requires the Union to combat illicit tobacco products, including those illegally
imported into the Union, as part of a comprehensive Union policy on tobacco control. Provision should, therefore,
be made for unit packets of tobacco products to be marked with a unique identifier and security features and for
their movements to be recorded so that such products can be tracked and traced throughout the Union and their
compliance with this Directive can be monitored and better enforced. In addition, provision should be made for
the introduction of security features that will facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are
authentic.
(30)
An interoperable tracking and tracing system and security features should be developed at Union level. For an
initial period only cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco should be subjected to the tracking and tracing system and
the security features. This would allow manufacturers of other tobacco products to benefit from the experience
gained prior to the tracking and tracing system and security features becoming applicable to those other products.
(31)
In order to ensure independence and transparency of the tracking and tracing system, manufacturers of tobacco
products should conclude data storage contracts with independent third parties. The Commission should approve
the suitability of those independent third parties and an independent external auditor should monitor their
activities. The data related to the tracking and tracing system should be kept separate from other company
related data and should be under the control of, and accessible at all times by, the competent authorities from
Member States and the Commission.

(32)
Council Directive 89/622/EEC ( 1 ) prohibited the sale in the Member States of certain types of tobacco for oral use.
Directive 2001/37/EC reaffirmed that prohibition. Article 151 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and
Sweden grants Sweden a derogation from the prohibition. The prohibition of the sale of tobacco for oral use
should be maintained in order to prevent the introduction in the Union (apart from Sweden) of a product that is
addictive and has adverse health effects. For other smokeless tobacco products that are not produced for the mass
market, strict provisions on labelling and certain provisions relating to their ingredients are considered sufficient to
contain their expansion in the market beyond their traditional use.
(33)
Cross-border distance sales of tobacco products could facilitate access to tobacco products that do not comply
with this Directive. There is also an increased risk that young people would get access to tobacco products.
Consequently, there is a risk that tobacco control legislation would be undermined. Member States should,
therefore, be allowed to prohibit cross-border distance sales. Where cross-border distance sales are not prohibited,
common rules on the registration of retail outlets engaging in such sales are appropriate to ensure the effectiveness
of this Directive. Member States should, in accordance with Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)
cooperate with each other in order to facilitate the implementation of this Directive, in particular with respect to
measures taken as regards cross-border distance sales of tobacco products.
(34)
All tobacco products have the potential to cause mortality, morbidity and disability. Accordingly, their manu­
facture, distribution and consumption should be regulated. It is, therefore, important to monitor developments as
regards novel tobacco products. Manufacturers and importers should be obliged to submit a notification of novel
tobacco products, without prejudice to the power of the Member States to ban or to authorise such novel
products.
(35)
In order to ensure a level playing field, novel tobacco products, that are tobacco products as defined in this
Directive, should comply with the requirements of this Directive.
(36)
Electronic cigarettes and refill containers should be regulated by this Directive, unless they are - due to their
presentation or function - subject to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) or to
Council Directive 93/42/EEC ( 3 ). Diverging legislation and practices as regards these products, including on safety
requirements, exist between Member States, hence, action at Union level is required to improve the smooth
functioning of the internal market. A high level of public health protection should be taken into account when
regulating these products. In order to enable Member States to carry out their surveillance and control tasks,
manufacturers and importers of electronic cigarettes and refill containers should be required to submit a notifi­
cation of the relevant products before they are placed on the market.
(37)
Member States should ensure that electronic cigarettes and refill containers comply with the requirements of this
Directive. Where the manufacturer of the relevant product is not established in the Union, the importer of that
product should bear the responsibilities relating to the compliance of those products with this Directive.
(38)
Nicotine-containing liquid should only be allowed to be placed on the market under this Directive, where the
nicotine concentration does not exceed 20 mg/ml. This concentration allows for a delivery of nicotine that is
comparable to the permitted dose of nicotine derived from a standard cigarette during the time needed to smoke
such a cigarette. In order to limit the risks associated with nicotine, maximum sizes for refill containers, tanks and
cartridges should be set.
(39)
Only electronic cigarettes that deliver nicotine doses at consistent levels should be allowed to be placed on the
market under this Directive. Delivery of nicotine doses at consistent levels under normal conditions of use is
necessary for health protection, safety and quality purposes, including to avoid the risk of accidental consumption
of high doses.
(40)
Electronic cigarettes and refill containers could create a health risk when in the hands of children. Therefore, it is
necessary to ensure that such products are child- and tamperproof, including by means of child-proof labelling,
fastenings and opening mechanisms.

( 1 ) Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products and the prohibition of the marketing of certain types of tobacco for
oral use (OJ L 359, 8.12.1989, p. 1).

(41)
In view of the fact that nicotine is a toxic substance and considering the potential health and safety risks, including
to persons for whom the product is not intended, nicotine-containing liquid should only be placed on the market
in electronic cigarettes or in refill containers that meet certain safety and quality requirements. It is important to
ensure that electronic cigarettes do not break or leak during use and refill.
(42)
The labelling and packaging of these products should display sufficient and appropriate information on their safe
use, in order to protect human health and safety, should carry appropriate health warnings and should not include
any misleading elements or features.
(43)
Disparities between national laws and practices on advertising and sponsorship concerning electronic cigarettes
present an obstacle to the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services and create an appreciable
risk of distortion of competition. Without further action at Union level, those disparities are likely to increase over
the coming years, also taking into account the growing market for electronic cigarettes and refill containers.
Therefore, it is necessary to approximate the national provisions on advertising and sponsorship of those
products having cross-border effects, taking as a base a high level of protection of human health. Electronic
cigarettes can develop into a gateway to nicotine addiction and ultimately traditional tobacco consumption, as they
mimic and normalize the action of smoking. For this reason, it is appropriate to adopt a restrictive approach to
advertising electronic cigarettes and refill containers.
(44)
In order to perform their regulatory tasks, the Commission and Member States need comprehensive information
on market developments as regards electronic cigarettes and refill containers. To this end manufacturers and
importers of these products should be subject to reporting obligations on sales volumes, preference of various
consumer groups and mode of sales. It should be ensured that this information is made available to the general
public, taking the need to protect trade secrets duly into account.
(45)
In order to ensure appropriate market surveillance by Member States, it is necessary that manufacturers, importers
and distributors operate an appropriate system for monitoring and recording suspected adverse effects and inform
the competent authorities about such effects so that appropriate action can be taken. It is warranted to provide for
a safeguard clause that would allow Member States to take action to address serious risks to public health.
(46)
In the context of an emerging market for electronic cigarettes, it is possible that, although complying with this
Directive, specific electronic cigarettes or refill containers, or a type of electronic cigarette or refill container, placed
on the market could pose an unforeseen risk to human health. It is therefore advisable to provide for a procedure
to address this risk, which should include the possibility for a Member State to adopt provisional appropriate
measures. Such provisional appropriate measures could involve the prohibition of the placing on the market of
specific electronic cigarettes or refill containers, or of a type of electronic cigarette or refill container. In this
context, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to prohibit the placing on the
market of specific electronic cigarettes or refill containers, or of a type of electronic cigarette or refill container. The
Commission should be empowered to do so, when at least three Member States have prohibited the products
concerned on duly justified grounds and it is necessary to extend this prohibition to all Member States in order to
ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market for products complying with this Directive but not
presenting the same health risks. The Commission should report on the potential risks associated with refillable
electronic cigarettes by 20 May 2016.
(47)
This Directive does not harmonise all aspects of electronic cigarettes or refill containers. For example, the
responsibility for adopting rules on flavours remains with the Member States. It could be useful for Member
States to consider allowing the placing on the market of flavoured products. In doing so, they should be mindful
of the potential attractiveness of such products for young people and non smokers. Any prohibition of such
flavoured products would need to be justified and notification thereof submitted in accordance with Directive
98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ).

information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 204, 21.7.1998,
p. 37).

(48)
Moreover, this Directive does not harmonise the rules on smoke-free environments, or on domestic sales
arrangements or domestic advertising, or brand stretching, nor does it introduce an age limit for electronic
cigarettes or refill containers. In any case, the presentation and advertising of those products should not lead to
the promotion of tobacco consumption or give rise to confusion with tobacco products. Member States are free to
regulate such matters within the remit of their own jurisdiction and are encouraged to do so.
(49)
The regulation of herbal products for smoking differs between Member States and these products are often
perceived as harmless or less harmful despite the health risk caused by their combustion. In many cases
consumers do not know the content of these products. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the
internal market and improve information to consumers, common labelling rules and ingredients reporting for
these products should be introduced at Union level.
(50)
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive implementing powers should be
conferred on the Commission concerning the laying down and updating of a priority list of additives for enhanced
reporting, the laying down and updating of the format for the reporting of ingredients and for the dissemination of
that information, determining whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour or has increased levels of
toxicity, addictiveness or CMR properties, the methodology for determining whether a tobacco product has a
characterising flavour, the procedures for the establishment and operation of an independent advisory panel for
determining tobacco products with characterising flavours, the precise position of health warnings on pouches of
roll-your-own tobacco, the technical specifications for the layout, design, and shape of combined health warnings,
the technical standards for the establishment and operation of the tracking and tracing system, for ensuring the
compatibility of the systems for the unique identifiers and for the security features, as well as establishing a
common format for notification of electronic cigarettes and refill containers and the technical standards for the
refill mechanisms for such products. Those implementing powers should be exercised in accordance with Regu­
lation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ).
(51)
In order to ensure that this Directive is fully operational and to adapt it to technical, scientific and international
developments in tobacco manufacture, consumption and regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with
Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adopting and adapting maximum emission
levels and methods for measuring those emissions, setting maximum levels for additives that result in a char­
acterising flavour or that increase toxicity or addictiveness, withdrawing certain exemptions granted to tobacco
products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, adapting the health warnings, establishing and adapting
the picture library, defining the key elements of the data storage contracts to be concluded for the purposes of the
tracking and tracing system, and extending measures adopted by Member States to the entire Union concerning
specific electronic cigarettes or refill containers or a type of electronic cigarette or refill container. It is of particular
importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at
expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,
timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.
(52)
The Commission should monitor the developments as regards the implementation and impact of this Directive and
submit a report by 21 May 2021, and when necessary thereafter, in order to assess whether amendments to this
Directive are necessary. The report should include information on the surfaces of unit packets of tobacco products
that are not governed by this Directive, market developments concerning novel tobacco products, market devel­
opments that amount to a substantial change of circumstances, market developments concerning, and the
consumer perception of, slim cigarettes, of waterpipe tobacco and of electronic cigarettes and refill containers.
The Commission should prepare a report regarding the feasibility, benefits and impact of a European system for
the regulation of ingredients in tobacco products, including the feasibility and benefits of establishing a list of

ingredients at Union level that can be used, or present in or added to tobacco products (so-called ‘positive list’). In
preparing that report, the Commission should evaluate, inter alia, the available scientific evidence on the toxic and

Tobacco and related products which comply with this Directive should benefit from the free movement of goods.
However, in light of the different degrees of harmonisation achieved by this Directive, the Member States should,
under certain conditions, retain the power to impose further requirements in certain respects in order to protect
public health. This is the case in relation to the presentation and the packaging, including colours, of tobacco
products other than health warnings, for which this Directive provides a first set of basic common rules.
Accordingly, Member States could, for example, introduce provisions providing for further standardisation of
the packaging of tobacco products, provided that those provisions are compatible with the TFEU, with WTO
obligations and do not affect the full application of this Directive.
(54)
Moreover, in order to take into account possible future market developments, Member States should also be
allowed to prohibit a certain category of tobacco or related products, on grounds relating to the specific situation
in the Member State concerned and provided the provisions are justified by the need to protect public health,
taking into account the high level of protection achieved through this Directive. Member States should notify such
stricter national provisions to the Commission.
(55)
A Member State should remain free to maintain or introduce national laws applying to all products placed on its
national market for aspects not regulated by this Directive, provided they are compatible with the TFEU and do not
jeopardise the full application of this Directive. Accordingly and under those conditions, a Member State could,
inter alia, regulate or ban paraphernalia used for tobacco products (including waterpipes) and for herbal products
for smoking as well as regulate or ban products resembling in appearance a type of tobacco or related product.
Prior notification is required for national technical regulations pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC.
(56)
Member States should ensure that personal data are only processed in accordance with the rules and safeguards
laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ).
(57)
This Directive is without prejudice to Union laws governing the use and labelling of genetically modified
organisms.
(58)
In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission
on explanatory documents ( 2 ), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of
their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of
a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the
legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.
(59)
The obligation to respect the fundamental rights and legal principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union is not changed by this Directive. Several fundamental rights are affected by this
Directive. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the obligations imposed on manufacturers, importers and
distributors of tobacco and related products not only guarantee a high level of health and consumer protection,
but also protect all other fundamental rights and are proportionate with respect to the smooth functioning of the
internal market. The application of this Directive should respect Union law and relevant international obligations.
(60)
Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products, cannot be

sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at
Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5
TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go
beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

Member States shall require manufacturers and importers of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco containing an
additive that is included in the priority list provided for in paragraph 1, to carry out comprehensive studies, which shall
examine for each additive whether it:
(a) contributes to the toxicity or addictiveness of the products concerned, and whether this has the effect of increasing
the toxicity or addictiveness of any of the products concerned to a significant or measurable degree;
(b) results in a characterising flavour;
(c) facilitates inhalation or nicotine uptake; or
(d) leads to the formation of substances that have CMR properties, the quantities thereof, and whether this has the effect
of increasing the CMR properties in any of the products concerned to a significant or measurable degree.
3.
Those studies shall take into account the intended use of the products concerned and examine in particular the
emissions resulting from the combustion process involving the additive concerned. The studies shall also examine the
interaction of that additive with other ingredients contained in the products concerned. Manufacturers or importers using
the same additive in their tobacco products may carry out a joint study when using that additive in a comparable product
composition.

exempted from the obligations pursuant to this Article, if a report on that additive is prepared by another manufacturer
or importer.
Article 7
Regulation of ingredients
1.
Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco products with a characterising flavour.
Member States shall not prohibit the use of additives which are essential for the manufacture of tobacco products, for
example sugar to replace sugar that is lost during the curing process, provided those additives do not result in a product
with a characterising flavour and do not increase to a significant or measureable degree the addictiveness, toxicity or the
CMR properties of the tobacco product.
Member States shall notify the Commission of the measures taken pursuant to this paragraph.
2.
The Commission shall, at the request of a Member State, or may, on its own initiative, determine by means of
implementing acts whether a tobacco product falls within the scope of paragraph 1. Those implementing acts shall be
adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
3.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down uniform rules for the procedures for determining
whether a tobacco product falls within the scope of paragraph 1. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance
with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
4.

this panel before adopting a measure pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. The Commission shall adopt
implementing acts laying down the procedures for the establishment and operation of this panel.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
5.
Where the content level or concentration of certain additives or the combination thereof has resulted in prohib­
itions pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article in at least three Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to
adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 27 to set maximum content levels for those additives or combination of
additives that result in the characterising flavour.
6.
Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco products containing the following additives:
(a) vitamins or other additives that create the impression that a tobacco product has a health benefit or presents reduced
health risks;
(b) caffeine or taurine or other additives and stimulant compounds that are associated with energy and vitality;

10.
The Commission shall, at the request of a Member State, or may, on its own initiative, determine by means of an
implementing act whether a tobacco product falls within the scope of paragraph 9. Those implementing acts shall be
adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2) and shall be based on the latest
scientific evidence.
11.
Where an additive or a certain quantity thereof has been shown to amplify the toxic or addictive effect of a
tobacco product, and where this has resulted in prohibitions pursuant to paragraph (9) of this Article in at least three
Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 27 to set
maximum content levels for those additives. In this case, the maximum content level shall be set at the lowest
maximum level that led to one of the national prohibitions referred to in this paragraph.
12.
Tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco shall be exempted from the prohibitions laid
down in paragraphs 1 and 7. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 27 to withdraw that
exemption for a particular product category, if there is a substantial change of circumstances as established in a
Commission report.
13.
The Member States and the Commission may charge proportionate fees to manufacturers and importers of
tobacco products for assessing whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour, whether prohibited additives
or flavourings are used and whether a tobacco product contains additives in quantities that increase to a significant and
measurable degree the toxic or addictive effect or the CMR properties of the tobacco product concerned.
14.
In the case of tobacco products with a characterising flavour whose Union-wide sales volumes represent 3 % or
more in a particular product category, the provisions of this Article shall apply from 20 May 2020.

to the competent authorities of that Member State a description of the details and functioning of the age verification
system.
5.
Retail outlets shall only process personal data of the consumer in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC and those
data shall not be disclosed to the manufacturer of tobacco products or companies forming part of the same group of
companies or to other third parties. Personal data shall not be used or transferred for purposes other than the actual
purchase. This also applies if the retail outlet forms part of a manufacturer of tobacco products.

( 1 ) Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions
laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services
(Audiovisual Media Services Directive) (OJ L 95, 15.4.2010, p. 1).

11.
In the case of electronic cigarettes and refill containers that comply with the requirements of this Article, where a
competent authority ascertains or has reasonable grounds to believe that specific electronic cigarettes or refill containers,
or a type of electronic cigarette or refill container, could present a serious risk to human health, it may take appropriate
provisional measures. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the competent authorities of other Member States
of the measures taken and shall communicate any supporting data. The Commission shall determine, as soon as possible
after having received that information, whether the provisional measure is justified. The Commission shall inform the
Member State concerned of its conclusions to enable the Member State to take appropriate follow-up measures.
Where, in application of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the placing on the market of specific electronic
cigarettes or refill containers, or a type of electronic cigarette or refill container has been prohibited on duly justified
grounds in at least three Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with
Article 27 to extend such a prohibition to all Member States, if such an extension is justified and proportionate.
12.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 27 to adapt the wording
of the health warning in paragraph 4(b) of this Article. When adapting that health warning, the Commission shall ensure
that it is factual.
13.
The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, lay down a common format for the notification
provided for in paragraph 2 and technical standards for the refill mechanism provided for in paragraph 3(g).
These implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
Article 21
Herbal products for smoking
1.
Each unit packet and any outside packaging of herbal products for smoking shall carry the following health
warning:
‘Smoking this product damages your health.’
2.
The health warning shall be printed on the front and back external surface of the unit packet and on any outside
packaging.
3.
The health warning shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 9(4). It shall cover 30 % of the area of the
corresponding surface of the unit packet and of any outside packaging. That proportion shall be increased to 32 % for
Member States with two official languages and to 35 % for Member States with more than two official languages.
4.
Unit packets and any outside packaging of herbal products for smoking shall not include any of the elements or
features set out in Article 13(1)(a), (b) and (d) and shall not state that the product is free of additives or flavourings.
Article 22
Reporting of ingredients of herbal products for smoking
1.
Member States shall require manufacturers and importers of herbal products for smoking to submit to their
competent authorities a list of all ingredients, and quantities thereof that are used in the manufacture of such
products by brand name and type. Manufacturers or importers shall also inform the competent authorities of the
Member States concerned when the composition of a product is modified in a way that affects the information
submitted pursuant to this Article. The information required under this Article shall be submitted prior to the placing
on the market of a new or modified herbal product for smoking.
2.
Member States shall ensure that the information submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 is made publicly
available on a website. The Member States shall take the need to protect trade secrets duly into account when
making that information publicly available. Economic operators shall specify exactly which information they consider
to constitute a trade secret.

TITLE IV
FINAL PROVISIONS
Article 23
Cooperation and enforcement
1.
Member States shall ensure that manufacturers and importers of tobacco and related products provide the
Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States with complete and correct information requested
pursuant to this Directive and within the time limits set out herein. The obligation to provide the requested information
shall lie primarily with the manufacturer, if the manufacturer is established in the Union. The obligation to provide the
requested information shall lie primarily with the importer, if the manufacturer is established outside the Union and the
importer is established inside the Union. The obligation to provide the requested information shall lie jointly with the
manufacturer and the importer if both are established outside the Union.
2.
Member States shall ensure that tobacco and related products which do not comply with this Directive, including
the implementing and delegated acts provided for therein, are not placed on the market. Member States shall ensure that
tobacco and related products are not placed on the market if the reporting obligations set out in this Directive are not
complied with.
3.
Member States shall lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted
pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures that are necessary to ensure that these penalties are enforced. The
penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Any financial administrative penalty that may be
imposed as a result of an intentional infringement may be such as to offset the economic advantage sought through the
infringement.
4.
The competent authorities of the Member States shall cooperate with each other and with the Commission to
ensure the correct application and due enforcement of this Directive and shall transmit to each other all information
necessary with a view to applying this Directive in a uniform manner.
Article 24
Free movement
1.
Member States may not, for considerations relating to aspects regulated by this Directive, and subject to paragraphs
2 and 3 of this Article, prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of tobacco or related products which comply with
this Directive.
2.
This Directive shall not affect the right of a Member State to maintain or introduce further requirements, applicable
to all products placed on its market, in relation to the standardisation of the packaging of tobacco products, where it is
justified on grounds of public health, taking into account the high level of protection of human health achieved through
this Directive. Such measures shall be proportionate and may not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a
disguised restriction on trade between Member States. Those measures shall be notified to the Commission together with
the grounds for maintaining or introducing them.
3.
A Member State may also prohibit a certain category of tobacco or related products, on grounds relating to the
specific situation in that Member State and provided the provisions are justified by the need to protect public health,
taking into account the high level of protection of human health achieved through this Directive. Such national
provisions shall be notified to the Commission together with the grounds for introducing them. The Commission
shall, within six months of the date of receiving the notification provided for in this paragraph, approve or reject the
national provisions after having verified, taking into account the high level of protection of human health achieved
through this Directive, whether or not they are justified, necessary and proportionate to their aim and whether or not
they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Member States. In the absence
of a decision by the Commission within the period of six months, the national provisions shall be deemed to be
approved.

necessary information at its disposal.
2.
In the report, the Commission shall indicate, in particular, the elements of the Directive which should be reviewed
or adapted in the light of scientific and technical developments, including the development of internationally agreed rules
and standards on tobacco and related products. The Commission shall pay special attention to:

(d) the feasibility, benefits and possible impact of a European system for the regulation of the ingredients used in tobacco
products, including the establishment, at Union level, of a list of ingredients that may be used or present in, or added
to tobacco products, taking into account, inter alia, the information collected in accordance with Articles 5 and 6;
(e) market developments concerning cigarettes with a diameter of less than 7,5 mm, and consumer perception of their
harmfulness as well as the misleading character of such cigarettes;
(f) the feasibility, benefits and possible impact of a Union database containing information on ingredients and emissions
from tobacco products collected in accordance with Articles 5 and 6;
(g) market developments concerning electronic cigarettes and refill containers considering, amongst others, information
collected in accordance with Article 20, including on the initiation of consumption such products by young people
and non-smokers and the impact of such products on cessation efforts as well as measures taken by Member States
regarding flavours;

The Member States shall assist the Commission and provide all available information for carrying out the assessment and
preparing the report.
