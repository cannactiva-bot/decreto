Abstract
Cannabis use has been associated with increased risk of becoming involved in trafﬁc accidents; however, the relation between THC concentration
and driver impairment is relatively obscure. The present study was designed to deﬁne performance impairment as a function of THC in serum
and oral ﬂuid in order to provide a scientiﬁc framework to the development of per se limits for driving under the inﬂuence of cannabis. Twenty
recreational users of cannabis participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study. Subjects were administered single
doses of 0, 250 and 500 g/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests measuring skills related to driving were conducted at regular intervals between
15 min and 6 h post smoking and included measures of perceptual-motor control (Critical tracking task), motor impulsivity (Stop signal task) and
cognitive function (Tower of London). Blood and oral ﬂuid were collected throughout testing. Results showed a strong and linear relation between
THC in serum and oral ﬂuid. Linear relations between magnitude of performance impairment and THC in oral ﬂuid and serum, however, were
low. A more promising way to deﬁne threshold levels of impairment was found by comparing the proportion of observations showing impairment
or no impairment as a function of THC concentration. The proportion of observations showing impairment progressively increased as a function
of serum THC in every task. Binomial tests showed an initial and signiﬁcant shift toward impairment in the Critical tracking task for serum THC
concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml. At concentrations between 5 and 10 ng/ml approximately 75–90% of the observations were indicative
of signiﬁcant impairment in every performance test. At THC concentrations >30 ng/ml the proportion of observations indicative of signiﬁcant
impairment increased to a full 100% in every performance tests. It is concluded that serum THC concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml establish
the lower and upper range of a THC limit for impairment.

1. Introduction
The acute effects of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on
isolated cognitive functions and psychomotor skills have been
repeatedly assessed in experimental studies employing within
subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. These have
generally shown that THC in doses between 40 and 300 g/kg
causes a dose-dependant reduction in performance on labora-
tory tasks measuring memory, divided and sustained attention,

reaction time, tracking and motor function (Ameri, 1999;
Curran et al., 2002; D’Souza et al., 2004; Hall and Solowij,
1998; Hampson and Deadwyler, 1999; Leweke et al., 1998;
Lichtman et al., 2002; Ramaekers et al., 2004). Performance
impairment after THC was usually highest during the ﬁrst hour
after smoking and declined to baseline over 3–4 h after THC
use. From a public health perspective, a major concern about
the acute effects of cannabis is the possibility of accidents if
users drive or operate machinery while intoxicated (Hall, 2001).
Cannabis induced impairment of driving has been demonstrated
in on-the-road driving tests (Lamers and Ramaekers, 2001;
Ramaekers et al., 2000; Robbe, 1994). The effects of cannabis
on driving increased with dose and were larger and more persis-

tent in driving skills requiring sustained attention. The degree of
performance impairment observed after doses up to 300 g/kg
THC were equivalent to the impairing effect of an alcohol dose
producing a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) ≥0.05 g/dl, the
legal limit for driving under the inﬂuence in most European
countries.
There is an increasing concern across EU and US member
states regarding the connection between cannabis use and road
trafﬁc accidents. From a legal point of view there is a great chal-
lenge of measurability and accuracy of interpretation because
the association between levels of THC and crash risk is not fully
understood. In virtually all western countries the policy regard-
ing driving under the inﬂuence of cannabis is in whole or in part
based on the detection of any amount of THC, the pharmaco-
logically most active ingredient of cannabis, or even its inactive
metabolite THC–COOH in blood or urine of the driver. Law
enforcement and policy makers often call for the adoption of per
se laws with a zero limit for THC or any of its metabolites. Such
‘zero-tolerance’ laws are already in place in several US states
and in other countries, such as Germany. Yet, there is little scien-
tiﬁc evidence to show that detection of THC or THC–COOH in
bodily ﬂuids can be taken as proof of impairment in any circum-
stance. For example, THC or its metabolite can be detected in
bodily ﬂuids for days after smoking and may thus indicate past
useratherthanimpairment.Moreover,impairmentandcrashrisk
afterrecentcannabisusehasbeenshowntoincreaseasafunction
of dose; little impairment is apparent at low doses whereas seri-
ous impairment develops at high doses (Drummer et al., 2004;
Menetrey et al., 2005; Ramaekers et al., 2004). Thus, a body
ﬂuid sample in a collision-involved driver that is positive for
THC merely indicates that the driver is a cannabis user. Plasma
concentrations of THC have been shown to vary widely between
1 and 35 ng/ml in drivers suspected of driving under the inﬂu-
ence (Augsburger et al., 2005) and between 1 and 100 ng/ml in
fatally injured drivers (Drummer et al., 2004). How varying THC
levels in plasma relate to driver behavior is presently unknown
but can be simulated in experimental performance studies of the
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of cannabis intoxica-
tion. Such studies will contribute to a science-based foundation
for government policies and law enforcement practices on
cannabis and driving in analogy to the system developed for
alcohol.
The present study was designed to assess the effects of a
medium (i.e. 250 g/kg) and high dose (i.e. 500 g/kg) of THC
on skills related to driving throughout 6 h post smoking. Skills
related to driving were assessed at regular intervals using labora-
tory tasks measuring perceptual-motor control (Tracking task),
motor impulsivity (Stop signal task) and cognitive function
(Tower of London). Likewise, blood and oral ﬂuid were regu-
larly collected in order to determine the pharmacokinetic proﬁle
of THC and its main metabolites throughout performance test-
ing. The main goals were (1) to assess the association between
cannabis induced performance impairment and THC concen-
trations in serum and oral ﬂuid; (2) to assess the correlation
between THC concentrations in serum and oral ﬂuid; and (3) to
determine threshold THC levels in serum at which performance
impairment emerges.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Twenty recreational cannabis users (14 males–6 females) aged 19–29
years participated in the study. Initial screening included a questionnaire
on medical history. Subjects who were pre-selected were examined by the
medical supervisor who also checked vital signs and collected blood and urine
samples. Standard blood chemistry, haematology and drug screen tests were
conducted on these samples. Inclusion criteria were experience with the use of
cannabis (at least ﬁve times in the previous 12 month); free from psychotropic
medication; good physical health as determined by medical examination and
laboratory analysis; absence of any major medical, endocrine and neurological
condition; normal weight; body mass index (weight/length2) between 18
and 28 kg/m2; and written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were history
of drug abuse (including daily use of cannabis) or addiction; pregnancy or
lactation; excessive drinking (>20 standard alcoholic consumptions a week);
hypertension (diastolic >100; systolic >170); and history of psychiatric
disorder.
The study was conducted according to the code of ethics on human exper-
imentation as established in the declaration of Helsinki (1964) and amended
in Edinburgh (2000). All subjects were fully informed of study procedures and
aims. All subjects gave their written informed consent. A permit for obtaining,
storing and administering cannabis was obtained from the Dutch drug enforce-
ment administration.
2.2. Design, doses and administration
The study was conducted according to a three-way, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, cross-over design. Subjects received THC placebo, 250 g/kg THC
and 500 g/kg THC on three separate occasions. A minimum wash-out of 7
days transpired between treatments. Smoking started in the morning of test
days (between 9.20 and 9.40 a.m.) and lasted for about 10 min. Subjects were
instructed to smoke the cigarette according to a ﬁxed procedure, i.e. inhale for
4 s, hold breath for 10 s and exhale/break for 15 s. This sequence was repeated
until the cigarettes were smoked as completely as possible. Cannabis cigarettes
were prepared beforehand for each individual from stock provided by the Dutch
Bureau for Medicinal Cannabis. Cannabis cigarettes were prepared from batches
containing 13% THC, a standard potency for cannabis sold at Dutch pharmacies
for medical use. Weight adjusted doses of cannabis were prepared for each sub-
ject individually and mixed with tobacco to a standard sized cigarette. Placebo
cigarettes equalled weight and size of active cannabis cigarettes, but consisted
of tobacco only.
2.3. Procedures
Subjects were asked to refrain from any drugs during the study period.
Subjects were not allowed to use alcohol on the day prior to an experimental
session and were requested to arrive at experimental sessions well-rested. Drug
and breath alcohol screens were performed prior to experimental sessions upon
arrival of the subject. Drugs screens (Mahsan® diagnostika) assessed for the
presence of morphine, cocaine, cannabis (cut-off level 50 ng/ml THC–COOH),
methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine. THC or THC placebo cigarettes
were only administered if a subject had passed the alcohol and drug screen on
a given test day. In the case of a positive drug screen, subjects were sent home
to return to the laboratory at a later time. Subjects were given a standardized
breakfast prior to smoking. Performance test were conducted at ﬁxed intervals
during 6 h post smoking. The Critical tracking task was conducted at 15 min,
1 h 15 min, 3 h 15 min and 5 h 15 min post dosing; a Stop signal task was
conducted at 30 min, 1 h 30 min, 3 h 30 min and 5 h 30 min post dosing; the
Tower of London was conducted at 45 min, 1 h 45 min and 5 h 45 min post
dosing. Subjects received a training session prior to onset of the experimental
sessions in order to familiarize them with the tests and procedures. Training in
Critical tracking and Stop signal task performance continued until the subject
had performed each task with less than 5% variance from the average measured
over three trials. Performance on the Tower of London task shows little practice
effect. This task was administered once during training.

2.4. Cognitive and motor tasks measuring skills related to driving
Three performance tasks were employed for measuring skills related to driv-
ing.
The Critical tracking task (CTT) measures the subject’s ability to control
a displayed error signal in a ﬁrst-order compensatory tracking task. Error is
displayed as a horizontal deviation of a cursor from the midpoint on a horizon-
tal, linear scale. Compensatory joystick movements null the error by returning
the cursor to the midpoint. The frequency at which the subject loses the con-
trol is the critical frequency or Lambda-c. The Critical tracking task measures
the perceptual-motor delay lag (i.e. psychomotor control) during a closed loop
operation (Jex et al., 1966) and is the closest laboratory analogue to on-the-road
tracking performance as measured in real life driving (Ramaekers, 2003).
The Stop signal task (SST) measures motor impulsivity, which is deﬁned
as the inability to inhibit an activated or pre-cued response leading to errors of
commission. The current test is adapted from an earlier version of Fillmore et
al. (2002) and has been validated for showing stimulant en sedative drug effects
(Ramaekers and Kuypers, 2006). The task requires subjects to make quick key
responses to visual go signals, i.e. the letters ABCD presented one at a time
in the middle of the screen, and to inhibit any response when a visual stop
signal, i.e. “*” in one of the four corners of the screen, is presented at predeﬁned
delays. The main dependent variable is the stop reaction time on stop signal
trials (i.e. stop reaction time) that represents the estimated mean time required
to inhibit a response. Stop reaction time was calculated by subtracting the stop
signal delay from the reaction time on go-trials associated with n-th percentile
of the reaction time (RT) distribution. The n-th percentile corresponds to the
percentage of commission errors (Logan, 1994).
The Tower of London (TOL) is a decision-making task that measures exec-
utive function and planning (Shallice, 1982). The task consists of computer-
generated images of begin- and end-arrangements of three coloured balls on
three sticks. The subject’s task is to determine as quickly as possible, whether
the end-arrangement can be accomplished by “moving” the balls in two to ﬁve
steps from the beginning arrangement by pushing the corresponding number
coded button (Veale et al., 1996). The total number of correct decisions is the
main performance measure.
2.5. Pharmacokinetic assessments
Blood samples and oral ﬂuid samples were taken between 0 and 6 h post
drug. Blood samples were taken right after smoking (5 min) and every 15 min
during the ﬁrst hour after smoking. From then on blood samples were collected
around the hour. Oral ﬂuids were taken right before smoking and every 15 min
during the ﬁrst hour after smoking. From then on oral ﬂuids were collected every
hour.
Blood samples were taken using glass venotubes without an anticoagulant.
Ten blood samples were collected per treatment condition. Blood samples (5 ml)
were placed on ice immediately, centrifuged later and frozen at −20 ◦C until
analyses for pharmacokinetic assessments. THC concentrations and its main
metabolites (THC–COOH and OH–THC) were determined in the corresponding
serum samples using solid phase extraction and gas chromatography with mass
spectrometric detection with a limit of quantiﬁcation of 0.5 ng/ml (Steinmeyer
et al., 2002).
In the case of oral ﬂuids, half of the subjects were sampled with an Orasure
intercept® device for a quantitative analysis by GC–MS (Kauert et al., 2006)
and half of the subjects were sampled by the UPlink/Dr¨ager Test system®. The
latter device is a rapid saliva test that was developed for use by the police during
roadside drug testing. The UPlink/Dr¨ager Test system® provides a qualitative
(yes/no) indication of recent cannabis use but cannot be used for a quantitative
analysis. The limits of detection for the GC–MS analyses and the Uplink/Dr¨ager
roadside testing device were 0.5 ng/g and 20 ng/ml, respectively.
2.6. Data analyses
Data sets were analyzed according to a three-step procedure. First, the pres-
ence of a signiﬁcant overall effect of THC on each of the three performance
tasks was established by means of repeated measures MANOVA with THC
(three doses), time after smoking (three or four time points) and their interac-
tion as main factors. Data collected during treatment with both doses of THC
were then converted into difference scores from placebo for further analyses
of the association between THC concentration and performance (i.e. differ-
ence score = performance during THC treatments −performance during placebo
treatment). Second, linear regression analysis was conducted to establish linear
relationships between changes (from placebo) in task performance during THC
treatment and log-transformed THC concentrations in serum and oral ﬂuid. The
totalnumberofdatapointsincludedintheseequationswasdeﬁnedbythenumber
of subjects × maximal number test repetitions × the number of THC treatments.
Third,individualTHCconcentrationsinserumpriortoperformanceassessments
in each of the THC conditions were divided over six mutually exclusive cate-
gories (i.e. 0–1, 1–2, 2–5, 5–10, 10–30, >30 ng/ml in case of the Stop signal
task and Critical tracking task and 0–1, 1–2, 2–5, 5–10, 10–20, >20 in case
of the Tower of London task) covering the full range of THC concentrations.
Corresponding change scores of task performance were then classiﬁed either as
showing “impairment” or “no impairment” for all individual cases within each
of these categories. Impairment was deﬁned as a negative change score from
placebo in case of the Tracking task and the Tower of London. Change scores
greater than or equal to zero were deﬁned as showing no impairment. In case of
the Stop signal task, impairment was deﬁned as a positive change from placebo,
i.e. an increase in stop reaction time. Changes in stop reaction times less than or
equal to zero were deﬁned as showing no impairment. Binomial tests were then
applied to measure whether the proportion of observations showing impairment
or no impairment signiﬁcantly differed from the hypothesized proportion. It was
hypothesized that in case of no effect of cannabis on task performance the pro-
portion of observations showing impairment or no impairment would be equal,
i.e. 50%.
3. Results
Complete data sets (N = 20) were collected for the Critical
tracking task and The Tower of London. In case of the Stop
signal task data sets for nine subjects were incomplete due to
technical malfunctions. All of these subjects were part of the
subgroupwhoseoralﬂuidweresampledwithOrasureintercept®
for quantitative analysis. Consequently, no correlation between
performance in the Stop signal task and THC in oral ﬂuid was
calculated due to the low number of complete data sets.

concentrations
of
THC,
OH–THC,
THC–COOH in serum and THC in oral ﬂuid after both
THC treatments are given in Table 1. These show that THC
concentration in serum (F1,19 = 14,93; p = .002) and oral ﬂuid
(F1,9 = 15,83; p = .003) were dose-related. Mean serum THC
concentrations after smoking the highest dose of THC were
about 1.5–2 times as high as compared to smoking the lowest
dose. Concentrations of THC in serum and oral ﬂuid followed
similar elimination curves over time.
A summary of the qualitative evaluation (yes/no) by the
UPlink/Dr¨ager Test system® of THC presence in oral ﬂuid from
a subset of 10 subjects is given in Table 2. These data show
that the proportion of false negative evaluations range from 30
to 70% in samples collected during the ﬁrst 6 h after smoking
either the low or high dose of THC. The proportion of false
negative evaluations further rose to 80–100% as the time post
smoking progressed.
Homogeneity tests of variance indicated that variances in
all three performance tasks were the same during THC and
placebo treatments. Overall, mean performance in the Criti-

cal tracking task (F2,18 = 9.41; p = 0.002), the Tower of Lon-
don task (F2,18 = 7.25; p = 0.005) and the Stop signal task
(F2,9 = 5.15; p = .032) were signiﬁcantly affected by THC. Rela-
tive to placebo, THC reduced critical tracking performance and
the number of correct decisions in Tower of London task and
increased stop reaction time in the Stop signal task. Mean (S.E.)
change scores from placebo for every performance parameter in
each THC condition are given in Table 3. There was no signif-
icant interaction between THC and Time after smoking for any
of the three parameters.
3.2. Associations between THC in serum/oral ﬂuids and
performance
Regression analysis showed weak but signiﬁcant linear rela-
tions between THC in serum and changes (from placebo) in crit-
ical tracking (p = 0.026, r = −0.13), stop reaction time (p < .001,
r = 0.32) and number of correct decisions (p < .001, r = −0.38).
Scatter plots showing the linear relationships between serum
THC and changes in performance measures are shown in Fig. 1.
Similar linear equations were derived from the relationship
between THC in oral ﬂuid and performance in the critical
tracking task (p = ns, r = −.18) and the Tower of London task
(p = .006, r = −.35). In addition, a strong linear relation was
found between THC levels in oral ﬂuid and serum (N = 10;
p < .001, r = .84). A scatter plot showing the linear relationship
between THC in oral ﬂuid and serum is shown in Fig. 2. No
correlations were found between changes in performance and
THC–COOH. Also, the sum of THC and OH–THC did not pro-
vide higher correlations with performance change than THC
alone.
3.3. THC threshold levels of impairment
Binomial tests showed a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion
of observations showing impairment in the critical tracking task
for serum THC concentrations >2 ng/ml (p < .05). In case of
the Stop signal task and the Tower of London task, signiﬁcant
increases in the proportion of observations showing impairment
were found for serum THC concentration >5 ng/ml (p < .05).

impairment” in each performance task as a function of serum
THC are shown in Fig. 3.
4. Discussion
The main ﬁndings of this study were (1) that linear, but
marginal relations exist between the magnitude of performance
impairment and THC levels in serum and oral ﬂuid; (2) that
THC levels in serum and oral ﬂuid are strongly correlated; and
(3) that clear cut-off levels in serum THC can be determined
above which performance impairment emerges.
The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of THC
were as expected. THC signiﬁcantly impaired cognitive and
motor performance in the Critical tracking task, the Stop signal
and the Tower of London task. THC induced performance
impairment were severe and clinically relevant when compared
to alcohol effects on the same tasks. During the ﬁrst 2 h
after smoking mean impairments observed during the Critical

tracking task were generally equivalent to those observed for
subjects performing the same task with blood alcohol concen-
tration (BAC) >1.00 mg/ml (Ramaekers et al., 1996). Between
2 and 6 h after smoking, THC induced tracking impairment
was comparable to BACs >0.5 mg/ml (Ramaekers et al., 1996).
THC induced impairments observed in the Stop signal task and
the Tower of London task were also noteworthy as previous
studies have shown that performance on these tasks is not
affected at BACs of 0.5 mg/ml (Lamers et al., 2003; Ramaekers
and Kuypers, 2006). Comparative data for higher BAC levels
are unfortunately not available, but it seems clear that it takes
BACs >0.6 mg/ml to achieve equivalent impairments in the
Stop signal task and the Tower of London task.
Both doses of cannabis produced maximal concentrations of
THC during the initial absorption phase at 5 min post smoking.
At this timepoint, mean THC concentrations were about 58 and
95 ng/ml after smoking the low and the high dose, with max-
imal peak concentrations of 160 and 240 ng/ml, respectively.
After both doses, mean THC concentrations rapidly dropped to
1–2 ng/ml within 3–5 h after smoking. THC concentrations in
oral ﬂuid were much higher than those in serum, but their ratio
appeared remarkably constant throughout the elimination phase.
Regression analysis showed a strong linear relation between
log-transformed THC in serum and oral ﬂuid (r = .84) indicat-
ing that in general changes in serum THC co-varied very well
with changes in oral ﬂuid THC. Similar correlations between
THC levels in both matrices have previously been reported after
controlled THC administration (Huestis and Cone, 2004) and
in regular drug users (Samyn and van Haeren, 2000). Together
these results suggest that the presence of THC in oral ﬂuid can
be considered as a valid biomarker of recent cannabis exposure.
It offers great opportunities for developing easy-to-use, non-
invasive, roadside drug tests for qualitative assessments of THC
in oral ﬂuid in drivers. A range of on-site, oral ﬂuid drug testing
devices has already been developed in recent years but the reli-
ability of these immunoassays has generally been sub-optimal
(Verstraete, 2005). In the present study, the UPlink/Dr¨ager drug
tester produced a considerable high percentage of false negative
evaluations, even shortly after smoking when THC levels where
high. The device was taken off the market shortly after comple-
tion of this study and will be replaced by a new generation of oral
ﬂuid testers in the near future. The challenge being faced is to
improve the analytic method of on-site immunoassays in order
to achieve the same sensitivity and accuracy as with laboratory
GC–MS techniques.
Regression analysis indicated linear relations between
changes in performance impairment and log-transformed THC
levels in both serum and oral ﬂuid. However, the associated cor-
relations were always rather low, in the range of 0.15–0.40. The
lack of a strong association seems to indicate that serum THC
cannot be taken as an accurate predictor of the magnitude of
performance impairment. Similarly, the overall lack of a sig-
niﬁcant interaction between performance impairment in any of
the performance tasks and time of testing suggested that THC
induced impairment remained relatively stable over 5–6 h after
smoking despite the prominent decline of THC in serum and oral
ﬂuid. The present data are in line with previous reports that have
shown low or inconsistent correlations between performance
measures and serum THC, particularly during the early distri-
bution phase (Cone and Huestis, 1993; Kelly et al., 1993; Reeve
et al., 1983; Robbe, 1994). The implication is that magnitude of
performance impairment is not a suitable parameter for deﬁning
threshold levels of THC in serum.
A more promising way to deﬁne threshold levels of impair-
ment was found by comparing the proportion of observations
showing impairment or no impairment as a function of THC con-
centration. That approach is not affected by the large variability
in performance impairment. It classiﬁes positive or negative per-
formance changes from placebo as showing either “impairment”
or “no impairment”, irrespective of its magnitude. Binomial

tests were used to test the statistical signiﬁcance of deviations
in the proportion of observations showing impairment or non-
impairment from the theoretically expected distribution within
six successive serum THC concentration ranges. It was hypoth-
esized that in case of no effect of cannabis on task performance
theproportionofobservationsshowingimpairmentornoimpair-
ment would always equal, i.e. 50%. The approach worked out
surprisingly well on all accounts. The proportion of observa-
tions showing impairment progressively increased as a function
of serum THC in every performance task. Binomial tests showed
a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of observations showing
impairment in the critical tracking task for serum THC con-
centrations >2 ng/ml. Between 2 and 5 ng/ml the proportion of
“impaired” observations was about 71% and gradually increased
to a full 100% at THC concentrations >30 ng/ml. In the Stop sig-
naltaskandtheTowerofLondontask,signiﬁcantincreasesinthe
proportion of observations showing impairment were found for
serum THC concentration >5 ng/ml. Between 5 and 10 ng/ml the
proportion of “impaired” observations were 75 and 90%, respec-
tively, and increased to a full 100% at THC concentrations >30
and 20 ng/ml, respectively.
Several THC threshold limits can be deﬁned on the basis of
the present results. First, there is the lower limit above which
performance impairment emerges in some but not all tasks
related to driving, i.e. 2 ng/ml. The proportion of observations
showing tracking impairment signiﬁcantly increased at this con-
centration, whereas performance in the Stop signal task and the
Tower of London task was still unaffected. It shows that tracking
performance is more sensitive to the effects of THC concentra-
tions between 2 and 5 ng/ml in comparison to tasks measuring
motor impulsivity or cognitive function. Previous studies have
also indicated that detrimental effects of low doses of THC are
more prominent in highly automated behaviours, such as road
tracking control, as compared to more cognitive driving tasks
requiring conscious control (Ramaekers et al., 2004). The lower
limit, however, also implies that there is no performance impair-
ment at serum THC concentrations below 2 ng/ml. In terms of
driving under the inﬂuence of cannabis this may be of partic-
ular importance in relation to residual THC concentrations of
0–2 ng/ml that can be found in frequent THC users (Giroud et
al., 2001) or even in non-users who have been passively exposed
to cannabis. Traces of THC in serum or urine are not likely to
be found after passive exposure to smoke of a single cannabis
cigarette (Niedbala et al., 2004), but have been demonstrated
after passive inhalation under extreme exposure conditions, i.e.
16 cannabis cigarettes for 5 days (Cone et al., 1987). Second,
there is the upper limit above which performance impairment
was evident for all observations. This was the case at THC
concentrations >30 ng/ml. The upper limit clearly is the most
liberal deﬁnition of a THC threshold that would predict abso-
lute impairment in all performance domains in each and every
individual. Finally there is the relative impairment limit at which
performance impairment emerged in a signiﬁcantly large pro-
portion of observations across all performance domains, i.e. at
THC concentrations between 5 and 10 ng/ml. Within this range,
frequency distributions of observations showing impairment/no
impairment showed a marked shift towards impairment in every
performance test, i.e. approximately 75–90% of the observations
were indicative of impairment.
In theory, it would also be possible to calculate limits of
impairment in oral ﬂuid from the linear regression equation
between THC in oral ﬂuid and serum. It should be noted, how-
ever, that the oral ﬂuid/serum ratio in the present study differs
markedly from that reported in another study (Huestis and Cone,
2004). In the present study THC levels in oral ﬂuid were gen-
erally 10–30-folds higher as compared to corresponding THC
levels in serum. In the study by Huestis and Cone (2004), THC
concentrations in serum and oral ﬂuid were very similar with
oral ﬂuid/serum ratios ranging between 0.5 and 2. It is presently
unknown why these ratios differ so markedly in both studies
but it may be related to between-subject variations in THC
contamination of the oral cavity while smoking cannabis or dif-
ferences in methods of collecting oral ﬂuid. Huestis and Cone
(2004) collected oral ﬂuid under stimulated (citric acid type,
sour candy) conditions, whereas in the present study oral ﬂuid
was collected under non-stimulated conditions. Collectors that
stimulate oral ﬂuid usually reduce drug concentration compared
to a non-stimulated manner (Drummer, 2005). It thus seems wise
at present to primarily employ oral ﬂuid testing for obtaining a
ﬁrst indication of recent cannabis use until methods for collec-
tion and analyses of oral ﬂuid have been standardized. In case of
a THC positive result, additional analyses should be conducted
in serum in order to establish a quantitative evaluation of THC
levels.
The present study will be criticized for the face validity of the
performance tasks and their ability to reﬂect driver impairment
or crash risk. Though it is evident that the present laboratory
tasks did not measure actual driving, it should be noted that the
laboratory tasks do possess sufﬁcient content validity. The test
battery is representative of mental and behavioural functions that
are relevant to driving. Previous work has also demonstrated that
some laboratory tests, though not all, can be predictive of real
life driving performance. For example, drug induced changes
in Critical tracking task performance have been shown to sig-
niﬁcantly correlate (r = −.45) to drug induced changes in road
tracking performance as measured in an on-the-road driving
test (Ramaekers, 2003). Whether drug induced driver impair-
ment as shown in experimental laboratory or driving studies is
also predictive of crash risk, however, may be more difﬁcult
to determine. It appears that construct validity of experimental
studies, i.e. their sensitivity to pharmacological drug effects, is
generally higher than that of epidemiological studies designed
to establish crash risk. For example, it is no problem in exper-
imental studies to demonstrate driver impairment for BACs as
low as 0.2–0.5 ng/ml (Ramaekers et al., 1992; Vermeeren et al.,
2002; Verster et al., 2002). Yet, epidemiological surveys have
repeatedly demonstrated that crash risk only starts to increase
at BACs >0.5 mg/ml (Borkenstein, 1978; Drummer et al., 2004;
Movig et al., 2004). Likewise, experimental studies have repeat-
edly shown driver impairment at low concentrations of THC
(Ramaekers et al., 2000, 2004) whereas epidemiological studies
have provided heterogeneous reports on the association between
crash risk and low THC concentrations (Drummer et al., 2004;
Laumon et al., 2005; Longo et al., 2000). Yet despite these

J.G. Ramaekers et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 85 (2006) 114–122
121
differences in construct validity, both experimental and epidemi-
ological studies can provide mutually supporting results. In the
present study, slight and selective impairment of tracking per-
formance was already notable at THC ranges between 2 and
5 ng/ml, but impairments became truly prominent across all per-
formance domains at serum THC concentrations between 5 and
10 ng/ml. These ranges seem to correspond well to recent epi-
demiological data that have shown a concentration-dependent
increase in crash risk in drivers positive for THC (Drummer et
al., 2004; Laumon et al., 2005). Signiﬁcant odds ratios (OR) of
crashriskforTHCconcentrationsrangingbetween1and2 ng/ml
and 2 and 5 ng/ml in whole blood were 1.45 and 2.13, respec-
tively (Laumon et al., 2005). At THC concentrations >5 ng/ml
in whole blood the ORs ranged from 2.1 to 6.6 (Drummer et al.,
2004; Laumon et al., 2005). When converted to THC concen-
trations in serum as employed in the present study these ranges
would be equivalent to 2–4, 4–10 and >10 ng/ml, respectively.
The present data thus supports epidemiological data and
shows that THC serum concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml
establish the lower and upper range of a per se limit for deﬁning
general performance impairment above which drivers are at risk.
It should be stressed, however, that the predictive validity of such
a per se limit is conﬁned to the driving population at large, and
not necessarily applicable to each and every driver as an individ-
ual. Individual drivers can widely differ in their sensitivity for
THC induced impairment as evinced by the weak correlations
between THC in serum and magnitude of performance impair-
ment in the present study. Even at a 5 ng/ml limit only 70–90% of
the observations were indicative of impairment, meaning that in
10–30% of the observations there was no impairment at all. The
purpose of a per se limit is to indicate the average THC concen-
tration above which drivers are at risk and should be interpreted
as such.
In summary, the present study showed a strong and linear
relation between THC in serum and oral ﬂuid. Linear relations
between the magnitude of performance impairment and THC
in oral ﬂuid and serum, however, were low. Classiﬁcation of
performance into observations showing either impairment or
no impairment provided a much better insight into the relation
between serum THC and performance impairment. An initial
shift toward impairment was evident in the critical tracking
task for serum THC concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml. At
concentrations between 5 and 10 ng/ml approximately 75–90%
of the observations were indicative of impairment in all three
performance tasks. At THC concentrations >30 ng/ml the pro-
portion of “impaired” observations increased to a full 100% in
all three performance tasks. It is concluded that serum THC con-
centrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml establish the lower and upper
range of a legal THC limit.
