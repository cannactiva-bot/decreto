Highly potent cannabis concentrates obtained by butane or by supercritical carbon dioxide-extraction are
gaining popularity. These extracts called butane hash oil (BHO) with D9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A
(THCA) contents above 60% are consumed by ﬂash vaporization on a glowing titanium nail, followed by
inhalation of the resulting vapor through a water pipe in a single puff — a technique referred to as
“dabbing”. We herein investigated the decarboxylation rate of THCA during artiﬁcial smoking of cannabis
plant material and simulated dabbing, and the lung availability of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which
we deﬁne as the recovery of THC in the smoke and vapor condensates. Preliminary smoking and dabbing
experiments were performed using an apparatus built in-house. Due to availability of cannabidiol (CBD)-
rich hemp in Switzerland, we included a sample of CBD ﬂowers in our experiments and investigated the
decarboxylation and recovery of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and CBD, respectively. Decarboxylation of
THCA and CBDA during combustion of the plant material and vaporization of the BHO, respectively, was
complete. The high recovery of total THC (75.5%) by dabbing cannot be achieved by smoking marijuana.
Lung availability ranged from 12% for mixed cannabis material with a rather low THC content, to
approximately 19–27% for marijuana ﬂowers, similar for THC in marijuana as for CBD in CBD-rich
marijuana. In reality, when smoking a joint, further losses in recovery must be assumed by additional
sidestream smoke. The rather high lung availability of THC via dabbing can explain the increased
psychoactive and adverse effects associated with this new trend of cannabis consumption.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, there is a tendency among cannabis users to
consume more potent products [1–3]. New strains of highly
potent cannabis plants have been developed and concentration of
cannabinoids by means of extraction has also been used to
produce extracts with very high D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
content: classical hash oil is extracted with solvents, and after
solvent evaporation, residues are mixed with a vegetable oil.
Seized drugs include butane hash oil (BHO) or extracts of cannabis
with other evaporable solvents, such as pressurized liquid carbon
dioxide — which have a total THC concentration of more than 60%.
A new form of application for these extracts is the use of a
titanium nail mounted on a water pipe. The nail is usually heated
by a gas torch until glowing red and then allowed to cool down for
a few seconds before a small amount of the cannabis concentrate,
called dab, is placed on the hot surface. The dab evaporates
quickly and the resulting vapor is inhaled in one single puff
through the water pipe. In a previous study, up to 60% of the
theoretically available THC could be recovered in the vapor
condensates
of
dabs.
Efﬁciency

from
the
concentrate to the vapor varied only slightly among concentrates
of different consistencies and qualities [4]. This new method of
cannabis consumption called dabbing has been imported from
the USA to Europe. Its rise in popularity seems to be a
consequence of the legalization of medicinal or recreational
cannabis in some states in the USA. The ﬁrst seized dabs sent to
the Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany, were
concentrates of butane hash oil that had a total THC content of
56–68%, as determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Accord-
ing to the labelling, the origin of these products was Washington
State (USA). In Switzerland, cannabis is only considered illegal by

the narcotics legislation if the total THC content exceeds 1%. CBD-
rich hemp with a total THC content below 1% can be legally
obtained as a tobacco substitute product in supermarkets or from
CBD-hemp shops and has become very popular since the
beginning of 2017 [5,6].
The aim of our preliminary study was to investigate the
decarboxylation of precursor acids of THC and CBD by dabbing and
by smoking, respectively. Furthermore, we wanted to determine
the recovery of THC in the condensate by dabbing in comparison to
smoking marijuana by use of two different setups of the smoking
device for simulation of the different methods of consumption.
Due to availability of CBD-rich hemp in Switzerland, we included
this material in our study.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Methanol (CHROMASOLVTM, for HPLC, 99.9%) was purchased
from
Honeywell
Riedel-de-Haën
(Seelze,
Germany),
hexane
(EMSURE1) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and acetonitrile
(HPLC gradient grade, 99.9%) from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium).
Formic acid solution (puriss p.a., 50% in water) was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrapure water was pro-
duced in-house with a Direct-Q water puriﬁcation system from
Millipore (Zug, Switzerland). THCA, THC, CBDA, CBD and cannabi-
nol (CBN) reference standards were acquired from Lipomed
(Arlesheim, Switzerland).
2.2. Cannabis products
The cannabis plant material (mainly ﬂowers — marijuana, or
mixed material consisting of leaves and stems) and cannabis
concentrate (BHO) used in this study had been conﬁscated by the
police
and
had
been
submitted
to
the
Landeskriminalamt
Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany, for routine determination of the
total THC, CBD and CBN content by a validated gas chromatograph-
ic method with ﬂame-ionization detection (GC-FID). For the
present study, samples
were re-analyzed by HPLC-DAD as
described below to quantify the neutral cannabinoids and their
carboxylic acid precursors separately and thus to determine the
original cannabinoid composition of the samples. CBD-rich hemp
(Cannabis Sativa L.) was obtained from Swiss Cannabis SA
(Härkingen, Switzerland).
2.3. Apparatus and method for condensation and recovery of
cannabinoids in smoke stream and dab vapor
A representation of the apparatus used for the smoking experi-
ments can be found in Fig. 1. One-gram aliquots of the dry cannabis
material (ﬂowers and mixed material) were pressed into a glass frit
which was connected by a short tube to two gas washing bottles in
series (Fig. 1). A platinum resistance thermometer was inserted
through a hole in the tube to monitor the temperature at the inlet of
the ﬁrst gas washing bottle. The bottles were ﬁlled up to about one-
ﬁfthof their volumewith 3-mm-diameter glassboilingchip granules
and were cooled in an ice bath and by liquid nitrogen, respectively, to
capture the smoke. The exit tube of the second gas washing bottle
wasconnectedvia a three-way valve to awaterjetpumpgenerating a
vacuum. The cannabis material was ignited with a gas torch and the
smoke was sucked through the two bottles. Marijuana was burnt in
approximately 2.2 min, for the mixed material the time was 3.5–
4.2 min. Smoke temperatures measured at the inlet of the gas
washing bottle were between 60 and 92 C for marijuana and 47–
80 C for mixed material.
To simulate the process of dabbing, the glass frit was replaced
by glass reducing/enlarging adapters equipped with a titanium dab
nail and the water jet pump was replaced by an oil pump for faster
suction (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the three-way valve was removed.
The titanium nail was heated with a gas torch until glowing red-
hot, allowed to cool down for a few seconds, and then 160–230 mg
of cannabis concentrate were placed on the nail using a weighing
boat. The evaporation of the concentrate and suction of the vapors
through the apparatus occurred in less than 5 s for simulating the
consumption of a dab. Measured temperature in the connecting
tube in front of the ﬁrst washing bottle during suction was on
average 44 C (n = 12, min. 36 C–max. 50 C).
After combustion of the applied plant material and vaporization
of the concentrate, respectively, the condensate was collected by
washing the boiling chip granules and gas washing bottles with
approximately 350 mL of methanol each. The obtained methanolic
solutions were combined and the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator and the residue was
reconstituted in 50 mL of methanol.
2.4. Quantiﬁcation of cannabinoids by HPLD-DAD analysis
Quantiﬁcation of cannabinoids of plant material extracts and
condensates collected in the gas-washing bottles was performed

by HPLC-DAD for THCA, THC, CBD, CBDA and CBN (without
decarboxylation). Aliquots of the dry, ﬁnely ground plant material
and the cannabis concentrate (BHO) were extracted with a mixture
of methanol/hexane 9:1 (v/v) by ultrasonication for 20 min
(ﬂowers: 75 mg/5 mL; mixed plant material: 50 mg/2.5 mL; con-
centrate: 75 mg/10 mL) and the extracts were then diluted 20- to
80-fold with extraction solvent for subsequent HPLC-DAD analysis.
The methanolic solutions (50 mL) of the smoke and vapor
condensates were analyzed undiluted and after 10- or 20-fold
dilution with extraction solvent to bring the cannabinoid concen-
trations into the calibration range.
HPLC-DAD analysis was performed using a fully validated in-
house method, with an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Olten,
Switzerland) and a Kinetex 2.6 mm C8, 100  2.1 mm column
(Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). Chromatographic sepa-
ration was achieved using gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid in
water as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as
mobile phase B. The ﬂow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the gradient
program was as follows: 0–2 min, 50% B; 2–9 min, 50–65% B; 9–
10 min, 65% B; 10–10.1 min, 65–50% B; 10.1–13 min, 50% B. The
injection volume was 5 mL and the detection wavelength was set at
210 nm. Linearity ranged from 1 to 100 mg/mL for THC, CBD and
CBN, and from 10 to 500 mg/mL for THCA and CBDA, with the
lowest calibrator being the lower limit of quantiﬁcation (LLOQ).
Limits of detection (LODs) were 0.3 mg/mL for THC, CBD and CBN,
and 0.5 mg/mL for THCA and CBDA, with signal-to-noise ratios (S/
N) of >3, tested with methanolic solutions containing decreasing
concentrations of cannabinoid reference standards.
3. Results
Table 1 displays the cannabinoid proﬁles of the cannabis
samples. In the cannabis plant, THC and CBD are synthesized as
pharmacologically inactive carboxylic acids, THCA and CBDA,
respectively. Conversion into their active neutral forms by
decarboxylation occurs naturally as the plant ages, and is
accelerated by light and heat (e.g. upon smoking, vaporizing or
baking the plant material) [7]. Since BHO production usually
involves little to no heating of the plant material [4], most of the
THC present in the concentrate is still in its acidic form. THC-rich
marijuana, mixed material and the BHO concentrate contained
only small or even non-detectable levels of CBD, CBDA and CBN.
The total contents of THC and CBD indicated in Table 1 correspond
to the sum of the free cannabinoid and its respective acid
precursor, corrected for weight of the carboxylic acid groups, and
thus refer to the maximum amount of THC that could theoretically
be present in the smoke or vapor as a results of complete
decarboxylation.
The cannabinoid contents in the trapped condensates were
analyzed to determine the theoretical lung availability.
Lung availability (see Tables 2 and 3) can be deﬁned as the
recovery of THC in the condensate (after burning/vaporizing the
material) in relation to the total THC content of the cannabis
sample (see Table 1).

The analysis of the condensates by HPLC-DAD revealed that
THCA and CBDA were not detectable, and thus decarboxylation of
the precursors during the burning/evaporation process was
complete.
Burning of marijuana took approximately 2 min, the burning of
mixed material up to 4.2 min, whereas the dabbing process for

seconds (<5 s). The recovery of the cannabinoids in the vapor
condensate was very high for the BHO (75%), while for marijuana
ﬂowers still 27% were recovered. For CBD, 20% were recovered
when burning CBD marijuana ﬂowers. For the mixed material,
which contained leaves and stems of the hemp plant besides
remains of ﬂowers, low recovery was found in the condensate.
4. Discussion
In the present study, the transfer of cannabinoids from cannabis
plant material to smoke (by burning) and from BHO to vapor (by
dabbing) was investigated.
4.1. Smoking
Ideally, the method of smoke production should reﬂect
human cannabis smoking behavior. The typical smoking cycle
consists of pufﬁng, smoke inhalation, breath-holding, smoke
exhalation and rest. Compared with smoking regular tobacco,
smoking cannabis was found to be associated with a two-thirds
larger puff volume, a one-third greater depth of inhalation and a
fourfold longer breath-holding time [8]. When cigarettes are
combusted, the smoke produced is either inhaled when puffs
are taken (mainstream smoke) or is released into the air when
the cigarette smolders between puffs (sidestream smoke) [9].
Previous studies have attempted to simulate authentic smoking
behavior
by
using
an
intermittent
puff
smoking
system
producing mainstream and sidestream smoke [10–16]. Howev-
er, as highlighted by Van der Kooy et al. [17], slight differences
in machine-smoking protocol (i.e. puff frequency, puff duration,
puff volume) may greatly affect the amount of THC transferred
to the smoke (i.e. the THC content in the smoke condensate will
increase if the puff frequency is shortened and the puff duration
and volume are increased). These observations are in agree-
ment with clinical studies showing that smoking dynamics
(manner in which the cannabis is smoked) inﬂuences the
amount of THC reaching the systemic circulation [9,18–23]. In
our study, cannabis smoke condensates were produced under
constant draft conditions, i.e. the cannabis material was burned
in a single, uninterrupted draft and no smoke was lost as
sidestream smoke, as previously described by others [11,16,24–
26]. Results thus obtained reﬂect the maximum proportion of
THC which could be transferred from cannabis to smoke rather
than a realistic estimate of the amount of THC delivered during
human smoking. Cannabis smoke condensates have been
collected using a variety of smoke collection devices such as
solvent
traps
(e.g.
acetone
[27],
ethanol
[16],
methanol
[10,24,26], ethyl acetate [28] ethanol/hexane 1:1 (v/v) [17],
cold traps [12,14], packed cold traps (e.g. sea sand [16], Pyrex
beads [13], Teﬂon ﬁlament [13]) as well as ﬁlters [15,25]. We
used cold traps partially packed with inert glass boiling chips
granules to increase the surface area onto which condensates
can form.
Previous studies in which cannabis cigarettes (without tobacco)
were machine-smoked in intermittent puff mode reported that
16–28.9% of total THC could be recovered in the mainstream smoke
condensates [12,16,29,30]. In contrast, continuous smoking on a
smoking machine yielded recoveries of 69% [16] and 78% [26].
Based on these studies, it has been estimated that 22–50% of THC is
destroyed by pyrolysis during smoking, while up to 40–50% may be
lost in sidestream smoke. Elzinga et al. [10] recently determined
the cannabinoid content in the mainstream smoke, sidestream
smoke and in the ash and ﬁlter of cannabis cigarettes, thus
arguably providing the most reliable data on the transfer of THC
from cannabis to smoke. They reported that, on average, 36.9%
(27.5–46.3%) of the theoretically available THC could be recovered
in the mainstream smoke condensate, 9.2% in the sidestream
smoke condensate, and 5.6% was found in the ash and ﬁlter.
Additional experiments demonstrated that the incomplete mass
balance could neither be explained by incomplete trapping nor by
adsorption losses on the interior surfaces of the smoking
apparatus, leading the authors to the conclusion that the missing
THC (approximately 50%) had undergone pyrolytic degradation.
Compared to previous results obtained under constant draft
conditions, our THC recoveries in the smoke condensates seem low
and ratherlie in the range of results obtained by intermittent pufﬁng.
This raises the question of whether the suction generated by the
water jet pump was not strong enough to prevent sidestream smoke
formation. Adsorption within the tubing of the smoking apparatus
couldhave causedfurtherlossof THC.However, asaminimal amount
of tubing was used, possible adsorption losses were assumed to be
minor. Since the cannabis material was not rolled into cigarettes, but
placed in a glass frit, the material was completely burned to ashes,
with no “butt” remaining. The residual ashes (~90–150 mg) were
extracted and analyzed for cannabinoid content. No cannabinoids
could be found. Separate analysis of the condensates collected in the
two gas washing bottles revealed that approximately 75% of
recovered THC got trapped in the ﬁrst bottle which was cooled in
an ice bath. Since the second trap was much colder (liquid nitrogen
cooling), it seems reasonable to assume that it was capable of
capturing the remaining condensable material. This assumption
could be tested by using a third trap. Therefore, incomplete
combustion and incomplete trapping were not considered to be
primary causes of the low THC recovery.
Under the inﬂuence of heat and light, THCA and THC can
undergo oxidative degradation to cannabinolic acid (CBNA) and
CBN, respectively [31–33]. Dehydrogenation of THCA upon
combustion was likely accompanied by decarboxylation thus
also affording CBN. However, a reliable estimation of the
percentage of theoretically available THC recovered as CBN is
difﬁcult, if not impossible to make since we cannot differentiate
whether
the
CBN
found
in
the
condensates
comes
from
dehydrogenation of THC and THCA upon combustion or from
CBN and CBNA originally present in the plant material, especially
since the CBNA content of the plant material was not determined.
As, however, the amounts of CBN recovered in the smoke
condensates were much lower than the amounts of THC lost
during smoking, degradation of the theoretically available THC to
CBN does not seem to be a major reason for the missing THC,
either. This leads us to conclude that the low THC recoveries in the
smoke condensates are most likely due to deﬁciencies in the
experimental set-up (i.e. loss of sidestream smoke) and/or due to
the fact that pyrolytic degradation was more extensive than
previously observed.

4.2. Dabbing
The vapor of a dabbed concentrate is usually inhaled in a single
breath. Therefore, in order to achieve realistic simulation of the
dabbing process, the water jet pump was replaced by an oil pump
which provided stronger suction. With 66.7–80.8% our recoveries
of THC in the vapor condensates of dabbed BHO were signiﬁcantly
higher than the recoveries in the smoke condensates and were
comparable to the maximal values measured by Raber et al. [4] for
various types of concentrates (not only BHO). However, they
observed that 18% of the potentially available THC remained within
their dabbing apparatus (tubing, water pipe, dab nail) and 3.1%
were found as THCA (not detectable in our study) which might
explain why their THC levels in the vapor condensates were on
average somewhat lower than ours. Furthermore, they suggested
that the consistency of the concentrate (i.e. content of plant waxes
and fats) might inﬂuence the efﬁciency of cannabinoid volatiliza-
tion. This could complicate the comparison of THC recoveries
obtained from different dabbed concentrates.
Combustion temperatures during cannabis smoking have been
reported to reach 500–900 C [16,30,34]. Dabbing, in contrast,
involves vaporization rather than combustion at lower temper-
atures [35]. The optimum vaporizing temperature depends on the
concentrate’s composition and the user’s preference. Low-temper-
ature dabbing is more ﬂavorful and tastier as terpenes are
preserved, while higher temperatures assure complete vaporiza-
tion without any material being wasted. “E-nails” users have
reported that they prefer temperatures in the range of 340–482 C
[36]. Heating the nail (made of titanium, ceramic, or quartz) with a
blow torch, which is more commonly, does not allow temperature
control and can quickly result in temperatures causing combustion
of the concentrate and degeneration of the cannabinoids, thus
decreasing the potency of the dab. Users discussing and sharing
their dabbing practices and experiences in public internet forums
recommend to heat the nail until it starts to glow red-hot, then let
it cool for 5–40 s before applying the dab to avoid burning [37–39].
In contrast to combustion, pyrolytic losses of THC should not
occur upon vaporization of cannabis material [26]. In our study,
however,19.2–33.3% of the theoretically available THC could not be
recovered in the condensate, while Raber et al. [4] found 39% to be
missing after accounting for losses due to adsorption within the
dabbing apparatus. As Raber et al. [4], we did not accurately control
the temperature during the dabbing experiments and applied the
BHO concentrates after the titanium nail had started to glow red-
hot and cooled down for a few seconds. This probably resulted in
temperatures at which vaporization was accompanied by com-
bustion, causing degradation of THC to polymeric material and
further unidentiﬁed degradation products, as suggested by Raber
et al. [4]. As in the smoking experiments, only minor amounts of
CBN could be found in the condensates, suggesting that conversion
to CBN was not a major route of degradation upon dabbing.
4.3. Comparison smoking vs. dabbing
When assessing the health risks associated with dabbing, the
question arises as to how much psychoactive THC is delivered by
doing a dab compared to smoking a joint. Studies have estimated
that the average joint contains between 0.2–0.5 g of cannabis
[40,41]. In online discussion forums, however, it’s not uncommon
for cannabis users to report numbers between 0.5–1.0 g [42].
For our calculations, we assume 0.5 g to be the standard amount
per joint and the total THC content to be 15% which corresponds
approximately to the average potency of today’s high-potency
cannabis found in several countries [43,44]. As outlined earlier,
cannabis smoking is a relatively inefﬁcient method for delivering
cannabinoids, with substantial loss of THC due to pyrolysis and in
sidestream smoke. Additional THC is lost in the butt. The transfer
efﬁciency of cannabinoids from cannabis to mainstream smoke
greatly depends on the smoking dynamics and machine-smoking
studies have yielded somewhat different results. Based on these
previous ﬁndings we consider 30% to be a good estimate for the
THC transfer rate. At this rate, 22.5 mg of the theoretically available
THC would actually be delivered to the smoker by consuming the
standard amount mentioned above.
The amount of concentrate used for dabbing is often referred to
as “small” or even “tiny”, which can mean different things to
different people, probably depending on their previous experience
with BHO and cannabis in general (tolerant and non-tolerant
users). While some users consider 25 mg a normal-sized dab and
50 mg a big dab, others say that 100 mg is normal-sized, 200 mg is
medium and 500 mg is a big dab [45,46]. For the comparison with
cannabis smoking, we assume that on average 50 mg of a BHO
concentrate with a total THC content of 70% are dabbed. At 75.5%
transfer efﬁciency, as determined in the present study, the user
would be exposed to 26.4 mg of THC. It’s important to keep in mind
that the calculated values refer to the amount of THC transferred to
the smoke and vapor, respectively, and not to the amount of THC
actually absorbed by the body through the lungs. The amount that
actually reaches the systemic circulation is smaller due to
incomplete absorption in the lungs. Factors such as the lung
surface area, deepness of inhalation and breath-holding time can
affect the fraction being absorbed. Our estimations show that, on
average, doing a dab delivers a similar amount of psychoactive THC
as smoking a joint. So, in this respect, we disagree with media
reports suggesting that taking a dab is equivalent to smoking
ﬁve joints [47] as well as with the estimations made by Raber et al.
[4] saying that a joint delivers considerably more THC than an
average dab.
The major difference, however, is that delivery of THC by
smoking occurs intermittently over several minutes (smoking
involves repeated inhalations over time), whereas upon dabbing
the available THC is inhaled in a single breath (<10 s), thus
producing a euphoric high that is perceived as much more intense.
The dabbing vapor is usually cooler than the smoke from a joint (in
our study by about 20 C) and contains far lower levels of irritating
combustion byproducts, making it more comfortable to inhale and
facilitating a longer holding time in the lungs. While several dabs
could be consumed in a row within a few minutes, smoking
multiple joints in the same amount of time would be much harder.
Thus, compared to smoking, dabbing provides an easier way to
quickly consume a massive dose of THC and is associated with a
greater chance of toxic effects than concluded solely from the
calculated amount of THC. Furthermore, this new trend in cannabis
use is more likely to lead to tolerance and to withdrawal
symptoms.
It is important to note that the presented ﬁndings are of
preliminary nature and further research involving more samples
will be needed to validate these results.
5. Conclusion
THCA is converted almost quantitatively to THC during the
dabbing process, when applying high temperatures to a titanium
nail, which has been heated until glowing with red color and
cooled down only a few seconds prior to application of the
concentrate.
This high recovery of total THC (75.5%) in the condensate by
dabbing
cannot
be
achieved
by
smoking
marijuana.
Lung
availability ranged from 12% for mixed material with rather low
content of THC, to approximately 19–27% for marijuana ﬂowers,
similar for THC as for CBD (in CBD containing marijuana). In reality,
when smoking a joint, additional losses in recovery must be

assumed, e.g. by sidestream smoke. Furthermore, factors like the
humidity of added tobacco or plant material itself, inﬂuences of
terpenes and of smoking habits (puff volume and frequency and
breath-holding time per puff) may play an additional role for the
lung availability of THC, since humidity and lower temperature in a
regular joint may inhibit the decarboxylation of THCA to THC. The
rather high lung availability of THC via dabbing can explain the
increased psychoactive and unwanted side effects associated with
this route of cannabis administration.
