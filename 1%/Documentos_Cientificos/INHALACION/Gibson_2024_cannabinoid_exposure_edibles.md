Abstract
Background: The popularity of edible cannabis products continues to grow in states with legal cannabis access,
but few studies have investigated the acute effects of these commercially available products. The present study
sought to explore the effects of three commercially available edible products with different levels of delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
Methods: A sample of regular cannabis users (N = 99) were evaluated. Fifty participants completed the study
procedures in-person, whereas 49 participants completed the study procedures remotely via Zoom. Subjective
effects and plasma cannabinoid levels (in-person participants only) were assessed before and 2 h after partici-
pants self-administered one of three products ad libitum: a THC-dominant edible product, a CBD-dominant
edible product, or a THC + CBD edible product.
Results: At the 2-h post-use assessment, among in-person participants, plasma THC and CBD levels were
robustly correlated with self-reported milligrams of THC and CBD consumed, respectively. Across all three con-
ditions, in-person and remote participants experienced (1) an increase in subjective intoxication and elation, (2) a
decrease in tension, and (3) no change in paranoia from pre-use to post-use. At post-use, participants who used a
CBD product reported less intoxication relative to participants who used a THC + CBD or THC-only product. Par-
ticipants who used a THC + CBD product reported consuming less THC—and displayed lower plasma THC levels
(in-person participants)—relative to participants who used a THC-only product, despite reporting similar levels of
positive (intoxication, elation, liking) and psychotomimetic (paranoia, tension) effects. Psychotomimetic effects
were very low among both in-person and remote participants across all three conditions, and there were no
post-use differences across conditions.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that experienced users who consumed a THC + CBD product reported similar levels
of positive and psychotomimetic effects relative to those who consumed a THC-only product, despite consuming
less THC and displaying lower plasma THC concentrations. Given the potential harms associated with acute canna-
bis reward and long-term THC exposure, further research is needed to establish whether edible cannabis products
with CBD pose less risk to users. Future studies should examine whether these effects generalize to samples of
infrequent users, who may have less experience with edible cannabis use. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03522103.

Introduction
The legalization of cannabis has led to an expansive
retail marketplace with increased production and sale
of diverse cannabis products and administration meth-
ods.1,2 Although the prevalence of edible use continues
to increase, the effects of legal market edible products
have not been rigorously evaluated in biopsychological
research studies due to federal regulations.3 Impor-
tantly, prior research ﬁndings may not generalize due
to differences in potency and composition between
cannabis forms used for research versus what is avail-
able on the legal market.4,5 Hence, there is a need to
investigate the effects of legal market edible products,
particularly those of differing cannabinoid concentra-
tions,6,7 as such studies can provide relevant and impor-
tant public health information.
Edible cannabis is a common consumption method
for medical cannabis users8,9 and older adults,10,11 sug-
gesting that it may satisfy the demands of a broader
range of adult buyers who do not want to inhale canna-
bis smoke or who want to avoid respiratory risks asso-
ciated with combustion.3,12–14 Although peak plasma
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol
(CBD) concentrations are observed rapidly after
smoking (*5–10 min), cannabinoids in oral formula-
tions undergo ﬁrst-pass metabolism, resulting in dela-
yed peak concentrations (*2 h)15–17 and prolonged
psychotropic effects that can last between 6 and
8 h.14 The interindividual differences in metabolism,
absorption rates, and delayed onset of effects make it
more challenging to study oral (vs. inhaled) forms of
cannabis.
In laboratory studies where the administered dose is
controlled, oral synthetic THC formulations mimic
some of the behavioral (e.g., anxiety, dysphoria) and
physiological effects (e.g., increased heart rate) typi-
cally observed after smoking ﬂower.18–20 Speciﬁcally,
among naive and infrequent users, the effects of THC
are dose-dependent, exerting positive effects on mood
and reward at lower doses21 but increased anxiety, dis-
sociation, and paranoia as the THC dose increases.22
Two clinical studies have shown that a single oral CBD
dose of 300 mg has anxiolytic effects with a dose-
dependent inverted U-shaped curve in healthy subjects
who were not observed at doses of 100, 150, 600, or
900 mg.23,24
Notably, however, although these dose-dependent
anxiogenic effects are often observed in naive and
infrequent cannabis users, they are rarely observed in
regular users.25,26 Furthermore, there is some debate
as to whether CBD might inﬂuence some of the acute
effects of THC. For instance, several studies show
that co-administering CBD with THC (via oral and
inhaled routes) diminishes the effects of THC on sub-
jective mood,27–31 whereas other studies have not sup-
ported this assertion,32–34 with one study suggesting
that CBD enhances the effects of THC on positive
mood.35
Since prior studies often utilize forms and doses that
are not representative of the products sold on the legal
market, it has yet to be determined how edible prod-
ucts commonly sold and used by the public may confer
distinct subjective effects. Therefore, externally valid
research designs will allow a better assessment of the
real-world effects users experience. Hence, the purpose
of the present study was to determine the subjective
effects of edible cannabis products and the extent to
which these effects might vary based on their relative
concentrations of THC and CBD.
In a sample of both in-person and remote partici-
pants, we tested three edible cannabis products that
are commonly available on the legal cannabis market: a
THC-dominant product (e.g., 10 mg THC, 0 mg CBD),
a CBD-dominant product (e.g., 1.65 mg THC, 25 mg
CBD), and a product with equivalent THC and CBD
amounts (e.g., 5 mg THC, 5 mg CBD). Participants’
plasma cannabinoid levels (in-person participants
only) and self-reported subjective effects were assessed
before and after ad libitum self-administration. Given
(1) that we conducted separate analyses for in-person
and remote participants, thus reducing our statistical
power, and (2) the dearth of research on legal mar-
ket edible cannabis products in general, these analyses
were considered exploratory in nature.
Materials and Methods
Participants
This study was approved by the University of Colorado
Boulder Institutional Review Board and was carried
out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants were recruited using social media adver-
tisements and mailed ﬂyers. Participants were com-
pensated $150 for their time and effort.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Univer-
sity of Colorado suspended all in-person research in
March 2020. Consequently, the research team made
the decision to ﬁnish the study remotely via Zoom
(zoom.us). The revised study protocol was also appro-
ved by the university’s institutional review board.
A total of 50 participants completed the study in-person,
AD LIBITUM USE OF EDIBLE CANNABIS
321

and a total of 49 participants completed the study
remotely. The primary difference was that participants
in the remote version of the study were unable to pro-
vide biological samples (e.g., blood). Importantly, there
is precedent for conducting acute cannabis adminis-
tration studies remotely.36
Eligibility criteria
Eligibility screening was conducted by trained research
staff. Participants were eligible for participation if they
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) between 21 and
70 years of age; (2) cannabis use (any form) at least four
times in the past month; (3) endorse prior use of oral
cannabis products; (4) no nonprescription drug use
(other than cannabis) in the past 60 days; (5) no
daily tobacco use; (6) three or fewer drinking occa-
sions per week, and < 5 (men)/ < 4 (women) drinks
per drinking occasion; (7) not pregnant or trying to
become pregnant; and (8) no current/history of psy-
chotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.
Baseline
appointment.
After
providing
informed
consent, in-person participants were screened via uri-
nalysis for pregnancy (if female) and the presence of
recreational drugs such as amphetamines, benzodiaze-
pines, cocaine, and opiates. A research staff member
also breathalyzed in-person participants to ensure that
their blood alcohol content was at 0%. Remote partici-
pants were asked to verbally conﬁrm that they were
not pregnant (if female) and had not used cannabis,
alcohol, or any other recreational drugs that day before
their appointment. Next, participants completed self-
report measures of demographics, substance use, medi-
cal history, subjective drug effects, and mood. In-person
participants then provided a baseline blood draw.
At the conclusion of their baseline appointment,
participants were randomly assigned to one of the
three oral cannabis products: (1) a THC-dominant tab-
let (e.g., 10 mg THC, 0 mg CBD), (2) a CBD-dominant
tablet (e.g., 1.65 mg THC, 25 mg CBD), or (3) a THC +
CBD tablet (e.g., 5 mg THC, 5 mg CBD). Participants
were instructed to purchase their assigned product at
a local study-partnered dispensary and were told that
they should use the products as they normally would
(i.e., no speciﬁc instructions regarding how many
tablets should be taken were given to participants). If
the dispensary did not have the assigned product in
stock, participants were instructed to purchase a tab-
let with a similar ratio (e.g., participants in the
THC + CBD condition could purchase other 1:1 prod-
ucts). Consistent with State of Colorado requirements,
the THC and CBD potencies of all study products were
labeled according to testing in an International Organ-
ization of Standards 17025 accredited laboratory.
Experimental appointment.
Between the baseline and
experimental appointment, participants were free to
familiarize themselves with their assigned oral canna-
bis product during a 5-day ad libitum use period.
On the ﬁfth day, participants completed the experimental
appointment. In-person participants completed the ex-
perimental appointment in our mobile pharmacology
laboratory (which was driven to the residence of each
participant), and remote participants completed the ap-
pointment over Zoom. Participants were instructed to re-
frain from cannabis use the day of their experimental
appointment. The experimental appointment included
two assessment time points: (1) pre-use and (2) 2h
post-use. Before using their oral cannabis product (pre-
use), participants completed a 5-day timeline followback
(TLFB) and the primary outcome measures (see below).
Then, in-person participants returned to their resi-
dence to use as much of their oral cannabis product
as they wished. For remote participants, research staff
members ended the Zoom call during this ad libitum
administration period. Participants recorded the time
they consumed their product as well as the total milli-
grams of THC/CBD. Two hours after using their prod-
uct, in-person participants returned to the mobile
laboratory and remote participants were called back
on Zoom to complete the primary outcome measures
a second time (2 h post-use). The 2-h post-use time
point was selected given ﬁndings that the psychotropic
effects of orally ingested cannabis reach their maxi-
mum after 2 to 3 h.14,37
Measures
Remote and in-person participants completed self-
report measures via REDCap (redcap.ucdenver.edu).
Subjective drug effects.
Subjective drug effects were
intoxication, elation, tension, paranoia, drug liking,
and ‘‘want more.’’ Intoxication was assessed with three
items, asking participants to indicate how ‘‘high’’ (10-
point scale), ‘‘mentally stoned’’ (5-point scale), and
‘‘physically stoned’’ (5-point scale) they felt. Items
were averaged to create a composite intoxication
score (a = 0.76).
Items from the Proﬁle of Mood States (POMS) ques-
tionnaire38 were averaged to create subscales of Elation
322
GIBSON ET AL.

(‘‘joyful,’’ ‘‘euphoric,’’ ‘‘elated,’’ ‘‘cheerful’’; a = 0.85) and
Tension (‘‘nervous,’’ ‘‘anxious,’’ ‘‘unable to relax,’’
‘‘shaky/jittery’’; a = 0.73), while a single POMS item
assessed paranoia (‘‘paranoid’’). POMS items were
assessed on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from
(1) not at all to (5) extremely.
Drug liking (‘‘do you like any of the effects you’re feel-
ing?’’) and ‘‘want more’’ (‘‘would you like more of the
drug you took, right now?’’) were each assessed with sin-
gle items from the Drug Effects Questionnaire39 ranging
from (1) not at all to (5) a lot. (Note: Drug liking and
‘‘want more’’ were only assessed at the 2-h post-use
time point.)
Plasma cannabinoids.
At baseline, pre-use, and 2 h
post-use, in-person participants had 32 mL of venous
blood drawn at each time point by a certiﬁed phlebot-
omist through venipuncture of a peripheral arm using
standard, sterile phlebotomy techniques and plasma was
separated from erythrocytes. Quantiﬁcation of THC, 11-
OH-THC, THC-COOH, and CBD was conducted using
validated high-performance liquid chromatography/
mass spectroscopy (API5500) in Multiple Reaction
Monitoring mode.40 All blood draws were conducted
at the start of each time point (baseline, pre-use, post-
use), before self-report measures.
Timeline
followback.
Participants
completed
two
calendar-assisted
researcher-administered
TLFBs,41
once at baseline and once at the beginning of the exper-
imental appointment. The TLFB queried their drug
use over (1) the 30-day retrospective time frame before
baseline, and (2) the 5-day ad libitum time frame be-
fore the experimental appointment.
Cannabis Use Disorder Scale.
Cannabis use disorder
symptoms were assessed using the Cannabis Use Dis-
order Scale (CUDS).42 The CUDS is an 11-item mea-
sure and was developed based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV’s criteria
for cannabis dependence.43
Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test.
To further
characterize the sample in terms of substance use, par-
ticipants completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identi-
ﬁcation Test (AUDIT),44 a 10-item measure designed
to assess participants’ alcohol consumption, drinking
behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. AUDIT scores
range from 0 to 40, with a score of 8 or more indicating
harmful or hazardous drinking.
Planned analyses
Primary analyses of plasma cannabinoid concentrations
and subjective effects (across the two experimental time
points: pre-use and 2 h post-use) were conducted sepa-
rately using a series of mixed-effects models estimating
random intercepts to determine whether conditions
were different in terms of their plasma THC levels,
plasma THC-COOH levels, plasma 11-OH-THC levels,
plasma CBD levels, subjective intoxication, elation, ten-
sion, and paranoia. In each model, as ﬁxed effects, we
included (1) linear change over time from pre-use to
post-use, and (2) a set of two orthogonal contrast
codes to test for condition differences.
For each outcome of interest (e.g., plasma THC),
we ran three models varying the set of orthogonal
contrast codes to test for relevant condition differences
in cannabinoid concentrations and subjective effects:
THC versus CBD, THC versus THC + CBD, and CBD
versus THC + CBD. Interaction effects tested whether
the linear change over time varied by condition, and
simple effects tests were conducted to determine condi-
tion differences at the 2-h post-use assessment time
point. (Note: As drug liking and ‘‘want more’’ were
not assessed at the pre-use assessment time point, we
conducted a series of linear regression models to deter-
mine whether these outcomes differed by condition at
the 2-h post-use assessment time point.)
All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (www
.rstudio.com). Mixed-effects models were conducted
using the lme4 package version 1.1–25, which imple-
ments maximum likelihood estimation, and linear
regression models were conducted in the stats package
version 3.6.2.
Results
One hundred twenty-four participants were recruited
for the study, of whom 110 completed both the baseline
and experimental session. Of those 110, 11 participants
were excluded from the analysis due to reported THC/
CBD mg that indicated that they did not use the assigned
product (e.g., a participant in the CBD condition report-
ing no CBD or high levels of THC in the product
they consumed during the experimental appointment).
Thus, the ﬁnal sample consisted of 99 participants
(men =41, women = 55, nonbinary= 3), of whom 50 par-
ticipants completed the study appointments in-person
and 49 participants completed the study components
remotely. Given the absence of biological veriﬁcation
for remote participants, we present results for in-person
and remote participants separately below.
AD LIBITUM USE OF EDIBLE CANNABIS
323

Combined analyses are presented in the Supple-
mentary Materials. (Note: No signiﬁcant differences
in demographics, cannabis use history, other substance
use factors, or milligrams of THC and CBD used dur-
ing the experimental appointment emerged between
in-person and remote participants.) Table 1 provides
demographics and baseline characteristics of partici-
pants across the three edible conditions as a function
of group (i.e., in-person or remote). Among in-
person participants, no signiﬁcant differences in de-
mographics, cannabis use history, current cannabis
use, or other substance use factors emerged between
edible conditions, indicating successful random as-
signment. Among remote participants, although par-
ticipants in the CBD condition reported using
cannabis concentrates more frequently at baseline
and over the 5-day ad libitum use period relative to par-
ticipants in the THC condition, no other signiﬁcant dif-
ferences emerged.
In-person participants
Milligrams of THC versus CBD used by condition.
First, to characterize milligrams consumed during
ad libitum use and validate product compliance
during the experimental appointment among in-
person participants, we report milligrams of THC
and CBD consumed during the experimental ap-
pointment by condition. As presented in Table 2,
in-person participants appeared to adhere to their
product assignment.

Plasma cannabinoid concentrations by condition.
See
Figure 1 for plasma THC and CBD levels across the two
experimental time points (pre-use, 2 h post-use) by
condition. Plasma THC levels at the 2-h post-use
assessment were strongly correlated with self-reported
milligrams of THC consumed (r = 0.74, p < 0.001),
and plasma CBD levels at the 2-h post-use assessment
were signiﬁcantly correlated with self-reported milli-
grams of CBD consumed (r = 0.87, p < 0.001).
Plasma THC.
Plasma THC levels increased from pre-
use to 2 h post-use across all three conditions (B = 4.32,
standard error [SE] = 1.11, p < 0.001). The CBD ver-
sus THC condition · time interaction was signiﬁcant
(B = 3.56, SE = 1.36, p = 0.01), such that participants in
the THC condition displayed a steeper increase rela-
tive to participants in the CBD condition. No other
condition · time interactions were signiﬁcant ( p> 0.17).
Simple effects tests indicated that plasma THC levels
did not differ by condition at the pre-use assess-
ment ( ps > 0.33). At the 2-h post-use assessment,
participants in the THC condition had signiﬁcantly
higher plasma THC levels compared with partici-
pants in the CBD condition ( p = 0.002) and margin-
ally higher plasma THC levels compared with
participants in the THC + CBD condition ( p = 0.07).
THC levels did not signiﬁcantly differ between partic-
ipants in the CBD and THC + CBD conditions
( p = 0.20).

Plasma CBD.
Plasma CBD levels increased from pre-
use to 2 h post-use across the three conditions
(B = 12.48, SE = 2.04, p < 0.001). The CBD versus THC
condition · time interaction (B = 14.63, SE = 2.52,
p < 0.001) and the CBD versus THC + CBD condition ·
time interaction (B = 12.87, SE = 2.43, p < 0.001) were
signiﬁcant, such that participants in the CBD condition
displayed a steeper increase relative to participants in
the THC and THC + CBD conditions. Simple effects
tests indicated that plasma CBD levels did not differ
by condition at the pre-use assessment ( ps > 0.66). At
the 2-h post-use assessment, participants in the CBD
condition displayed signiﬁcantly higher CBD levels
compared with participants in the THC ( p < 0.001)
and THC + CBD ( p < 0.001) conditions. CBD levels
did not signiﬁcantly differ between participants in the
THC and THC+ CBD conditions ( p = 0.35).
Plasma 11-OH-THC.
Plasma 11-OH-THC levels in-
creased from pre-use to 2 h post-use across the three
conditions (B = 2.70, SE = 0.60, p < 0.001). There were
no signiﬁcant condition · time interactions ( ps > 0.45).
Simple effects tests indicated that plasma 11-OH-THC
levels did not differ by condition at the pre- or post-
use assessments ( ps > 0.35).
Plasma THC-COOH.
Plasma THC-COOH levels in-
creased from pre-use to 2 h post-use across the three
conditions (B = 11.22, SE = 4.25, p = 0.01). There were
no signiﬁcant condition · time interactions ( ps > 0.76).
Simple effects tests indicated that plasma THC-
COOH levels did not differ by condition at the pre-
or post-use assessments ( ps > 0.10).
Subjective

Zero-order correlations between 2-h
post-use plasma cannabinoid levels and subjective
effects are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
Subjective intoxication.
There was a signiﬁcant increase
in intoxication from pre-use to 2 h post-use (B = 2.00,
SE = 0.18,
p < 0.001)
across
all
three
conditions
(Fig. 2A). The CBD versus THC + CBD condition ·
time interaction was signiﬁcant (B = 0.58, SE = 0.21,
p = 0.01), and the CBD versus THC condition · time
interaction was marginally signiﬁcant (B = 0.37, SE =
0.22, p = 0.10), such that participants in the THC and
THC + CBD conditions displayed a steeper increase
in subjective intoxication relative to participants in
the CBD condition. Simple effects tests indicated that
at the 2-h post-use assessment, participants in the
THC condition ( p = 0.01) and THC + CBD conditions
( p < 0.001) reported greater intoxication than partici-
pants in the CBD condition. Participants reported
similar levels of intoxication in the THC and THC +
CBD conditions ( p = 0.40).
Elation.
There was a signiﬁcant increase in elation
from pre-use to 2 h post-use (B = 0.23, SE = 0.10,
p = 0.03) across all three conditions (Fig. 2B). There
were
no
signiﬁcant
condition · time
interactions
( ps > 0.20). No condition differences in elation emerged
at the post-use assessment ( ps > 0.11).
Tension.
There was a marginal decrease in tension
from pre-use to 2 h post-use (B = 0.09, SE = 0.06,
p = 0.11) across all three conditions (Fig. 2C). There
were
no
signiﬁcant
condition · time
interactions
( ps> 0.36). No condition differences in tension emerged
at the post-use assessment ( ps > 0.27).
Paranoia.
There was not a signiﬁcant change in para-
noia from pre-use to 2 h post-use (B = 0.04, SE = 0.06,
p = 0.55) across conditions (Fig. 2D). There were no
signiﬁcant condition · time interactions ( ps > 0.23).
No condition differences in paranoia emerged at the
post-use assessment ( ps > 0.60).
Drug liking.
At 2 h post-use, drug liking was similar
between participants in the THC and THC +CBD condi-
tions(B = 0.11, SE = 0.16, p = 0.50), THC and CBD condi-
tions (B= 0.07, SE = 0.17, p =0.68), and THC+ CBD and
CBD conditions (B = 0.04, SE= 0.16, p =0.80; Fig. 3A).
‘‘Want More’’.

Discussion
The growing popularity of edible cannabis has ignited
a public health need for current and externally valid
research data on their acute psychological effects. To
understand how edible forms of cannabis may confer
distinct subjective effects, the present study utilized

an observational design with high external validity to
determine the extent to which the subjective effects
of edibles vary based on their relative THC and CBD
concentrations. As expected, among both in-person and
remote participants, participants in the CBD condition
reported consuming less THC and more CBD relative
to participants in the THC and THC+CBD conditions.
In addition, individuals in the THC +CBD condition used
less THC than those in the THC condition. Furthermore,
among in-person participants, plasma THC and CBD
concentrations at the post-use time point were strongly
correlated with milligrams of THC and CBD consumed
during ad libitum administration, respectively. The
strength of these correlations is in line with previous
controlled oral administration studies,14 as well as a
previous naturalistic study that compared plasma can-
nabinoid concentrations among ﬂower and edible
users,45 supporting the validity of self-reported canna-
binoid use based on information contained on Colo-
rado state product labels.
We also examined how subjective effects differed
across the conditions. As expected, among both

post-use assessment. Error bars are standard errors. All subjective effects were assessed on a 1 to 5 scale,
with the exception of subjective intoxication ratings, which ranged from 1 to 6.67.
AD LIBITUM USE OF EDIBLE CANNABIS

in-person and remote participants, there were differ-
ences in subjective intoxication, with participants in
the THC and THC + CBD conditions reporting greater
intoxication relative to participants in the CBD condi-
tion. Interestingly, individuals in the THC + CBD con-
dition reported similar levels of positive effects
(intoxication, elation, liking) as those in the THC con-
dition, despite consuming *50% less THC, which rep-
licates our previous ﬁnding using inhaled cannabis.46
Moreover, this ﬁnding may be due to the habitual use
of cannabis in our sample as controlled administration
studies have shown that the positive subjective effects
of THC (e.g., ‘‘high,’’ ‘‘liking’’) were not dose-dependent
in habitual/frequent cannabis users,47–49 but THC can
dose-dependently alter subjective effects in non-habit-
ual/infrequent cannabis users.48,50
Interestingly, among in-person participants, partici-
pants in the CBD condition expressed a greater desire
to use more of their product relative to participants
in both THC conditions, although the difference
between the CBD and THC condition was not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. This ﬁnding contradicts previous
research suggesting that THC produces greater drug
craving effects after acute use.48 However, this may
reﬂect participants in the CBD condition needing to
use more cannabis to achieve their desired high.
Although the same pattern of drug craving was obser-
ved among remote participants, none of the condi-
tion differences were signiﬁcant. Additionally, among
remote participants, participants in the CBD condition
reported signiﬁcantly less drug liking than participants
in the THC and THC + CBD conditions.
The same pattern was not observed among in-
person participants. As remote participants in the
CBD condition reported using cannabis concentrates
more frequently at baseline and during the 5-day
ad libitum use period relative to remote participants
in the THC condition, this may reﬂect a preference
for higher potency products among these participants.
Among both in-person and remote participants, other
mood outcomes were similar across all three condi-
tions; this ﬁnding supports previous naturalistic and
controlled administration studies, which have found
that co-administering CBD with THC does not dimin-
ish THCs positive subjective effects (e.g., Haney et al33
and Gibson et al46), a ﬁnding that has also been
observed in both light and heavy cannabis users, as
well as a previous report suggesting that CBD may
actually enhance the effects of THC on positive
mood.35
Previous research suggests that oral formulations
of cannabis are associated with an increased risk of
adverse experiences relative to combustible cannabis
products due to difﬁculties associated with precise dos-
ing and an increased likelihood of overconsump-
tion.12–14 Interestingly, however, across all conditions,

GIBSON ET AL.

in-person and remote participants reported low levels
of psychotomimetic effects (i.e., tension, paranoia) at
the post-use time point, and tension actually decreased
after
cannabis
consumption,
although
marginally
among in-person participants. This ﬁnding is surpris-
ing, given that THC has been associated with increased
anxiety and paranoia at higher doses,22 and many par-
ticipants in the THC and THC + CBD conditions
reported consuming signiﬁcantly more than 10 mg of
THC, which is considered a ‘‘standard dose’’ in several
states with legal cannabis access.12
Notably, although these results contradict previous
ﬁndings from controlled administration studies show-
ing an increase in anxiety after consumption of oral
THC,22 they are in line with a previous study in
which frequent cannabis users did not experience a
change in paranoia after acute use of vaporized canna-
bis as was observed in non-using healthy controls.51
Due to the well-documented effects of long-term can-
nabis use on CB1 receptor density, it is possible that
our participants, who are experienced cannabis users,
have developed a tolerance to THCs psychotomimetic
effects.49 However, as the psychotropic effects of orally
ingested cannabis reach their maximum after 2 to 3 h,14
it is also possible that participants could have experi-
enced greater psychotomimetic effects at a later time
point (e.g., 3 h), after the study had concluded.
Indeed, as the full pharmacokinetic curve was not
assessed in this naturalistic study, it is possible that
the full range of group differences in drug effects may
not have been captured by our design. The single
post-use time point also limits our ability to capture
group differences in plasma cannabinoid concentra-
tions among in-person participants, as peak concen-
trations of cannabinoids in the blood may have
varied due to differences in within-subject physiologi-
cal factors, such as absorption, metabolic rates, and
excretion. However, prior studies have shown that
the Tmax of orally consumed cannabinoids is not
dose-dependent or affected by the frequency of current
or prior cannabis use. Future studies should assess the
full pharmacokinetic curve so that the full range of
group differences in drug effects and plasma cannabi-
noid concentrations are captured.
Strengths of the present study include its federally
compatible, naturalistic design, which emphasizes
external validity and allows us to study cannabis prod-
ucts that are widely available in state-regulated mar-
kets. Although tightly controlled laboratory studies
are important for establishing internal validity, it is
also critical to study the cannabis forms and doses
that are widely available in the legal market, in a setting
that reﬂects the conditions in which individuals con-
sume cannabis in real life. This study also provides
new data on the amounts of THC and CBD people
choose to use when they are free to consume edible
cannabis products as they would normally. Addition-
ally, participants were randomized to conditions that
differed in cannabinoid composition (i.e., THC, THC +
CBD, CBD), making this the ﬁrst study, to the best of
our knowledge, to examine the effects of legal market
edible cannabis products with varying ratios of THC
and CBD.
Despite these strengths, several important limita-
tions should be noted. First, as this was a naturalistic
study, there was no placebo-control condition and
participants
administered
their
assigned
product
ad libitum rather than consuming controlled doses
using a standardized administration protocol, which
limits our ability to pinpoint causal effects. Indeed,
the milligrams consumed varied widely within and be-
tween conditions. For instance, among both in-person
and remote participants, milligrams of THC consu-
med in the CBD condition ranged widely (i.e., from
0.30 to 11.55 mg among in-person participants and
from 0.75 to 50.0 mg among remote participants),
meaning that some participants in the CBD condition
were consuming more THC than participants in the
THC and THC + CBD conditions.
Additionally, although participants were instructed
to use ad libitum (i.e., as they would when using canna-
bis in their daily life) and could thus use as few or as
many tablets as they liked, it is possible that the
lower THC content per tablet in the THC + CBD con-
dition (5 mg vs. 10 mg)—rather than the inclusion of
CBD—led participants to consume fewer tablets relative
to participants in the THC condition. As such, future
naturalistic studies should match THC and THC+ CBD
tablets on THC potency. Furthermore, although most
participants in the THC+ CBD condition were able to
purchase the assigned study product (5mg THC, 5 mg
CBD), a small number of remote participants (n = 6)
had to purchase a different 1:1 product containing
10 mg THC and 10 mg CBD. As such, it is possible
that this led to additional variability in dosing among re-
mote participants in the THC + CBD condition. How-
ever, as all participants were experienced edible users
who were instructed to use according to their typical
use patterns, any variability is likely the result of individ-
ual differences in typical use. Future studies should
AD LIBITUM USE OF EDIBLE CANNABIS
331

investigate whether edible packaging inﬂuences the
amount of cannabis consumed by both regular and nov-
ice users.
It is also important to note that due to restrictions
surrounding in-person research during the COVID-19
pandemic, not all participants completed the study in
the same setting; approximately half completed the
experimental session in a mobile laboratory, whereas
the other half completed the experimental session via
Zoom in their own residences. Due to the change
to a remote modality halfway through the study, we
were unable to conduct breathalyzer, blood, and
urine tests for 49 participants; for these participants,
we had to rely on self-report data and were unable to
biologically conﬁrm that participants had adhered to
their product assignment and abstained from other
substance use.
Given that were unable to biologically conﬁrm
product compliance for these participants, along with
research suggesting that participants behave differently
when they know there will be biological veriﬁcation,52
we elected to analyze the in-person and remote groups
separately. As such, we were not fully powered to detect
the effects of interest and ﬁndings should be inter-
preted with caution. It is important to note, however,
that ﬁndings in each group—as well as the combined
sample presented in the Supplementary Materials—
were largely similar. Nevertheless, it is still possible
that differences in study settings could have impacted
unmeasured aspects of participants’ subjective expe-
rience of acute cannabis use. Future, fully powered
research designs that compare ﬁndings across in-person
and remote modalities are needed to assess whether
remote modalities are a viable alternative to in-person
methods when it comes to conducting acute adminis-
tration studies of legal market cannabis products.
Additionally, although researchers were blind to
condition, participants were not, as state legislation
requires the THC and CBD potency of all legal market
products to be labeled. Thus, it is possible that partici-
pants’ expectancies could have inﬂuenced their self-
reports of subjective drug and mood effects. Notably,
although a recent report found the cannabinoid con-
tent on edible packing in the State of Colorado to be
reasonably accurate,53 other studies have found that
cannabinoid content is often mislabeled,54 raising the
possibility that participants were consuming their prod-
ucts at higher or lower doses than intended. Further-
more, among remote participants, participants in the
CBD condition reported using cannabis concentrates
more frequently than participants in the THC condi-
tion, raising the possibility that ﬁndings may be driven,
in part, by baseline differences in cannabis use patterns.
Although the number of days participants used
study and non-study cannabis products during the
5-day ad libitum use period did not differ by condi-
tion among in-person participants, it is possible that un-
measured differences in use patterns could have
impacted their responses during the experimental ses-
sion. Finally, participants were also regular cannabis
users, and reported using cannabis edibles an average
of 6.60 days per month (in-person participants= 7.44, re-
mote participants = 5.73) and cannabis ﬂower an average
of 13.91 days per month (in-person participants= 12.82,
remote participants= 15.04). As such, these ﬁndings may
not generalize to infrequent or naive users.
Conclusions
The popularity of edible cannabis products is increas-
ing in states with legal cannabis access;6–8 however,
few studies have examined ad libitum use and the
acute effects of commercially available cannabis edi-
bles.45 This is the ﬁrst study, to the best of our knowl-
edge, that has explored whether the acute effects of
these products vary as a function of their cannabinoid
content, notably the inclusion of CBD. Results suggest
that, across both study modalities, participants using
a THC + CBD product reported similar levels of posi-
tive (e.g., intoxication, elation, liking) and negative
(e.g., tension, paranoia) effects relative to participants
using a THC-only product. Notably, despite reporting
similar levels of subjective effects after acute use, partic-
ipants in the THC + CBD condition consumed less
THC relative to participants in the THC condition.
Furthermore, in-person participants in the THC +
CBD condition displayed lower levels of THC expo-
sure relative to participants in the THC condition.
Given the potential harms associated with short- and
long-term THC exposure (e.g., cognitive impair-
ment),55 the ability to achieve similar levels of desir-
able effects—such as elation, high, and reductions in
tension—at a lower THC dose has important harm
reduction potential. At the same time, given possible
risks associated with increased acute cannabis reward,
to the extent that CBD enhances THCs effects,35
these products could be associated with more risk. Fur-
ther research, which compares THC and THC + CBD
products matched on THC potency, is needed to estab-
lish whether THC + CBD products may pose less risks
to users relative to THC-only products.
