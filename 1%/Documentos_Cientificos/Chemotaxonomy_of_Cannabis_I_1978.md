CHEMOTAXONOMY OF CANNABIS I. CROSSBREEDING BETWEEN
CANNABIS SATIVA AND C. RUDERALIS, WITH
ANALYSIS OF CANNABINOID CONTENT
JOHN A. BEUTLER1 AND ARA H. DER MARDEROSIAN
A controlled cross between Cannabis sativa L. and C. ruderalis Janisch. gave
progeny intermediate in both cannabinoid content and morphology. The progeny
fell into two distinct populations, those whose tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) con-
tent was closer to the C. sativa parent (greater than 60% of total cannabinoids)
and those whose THC content was closer to the C. ruderalis parent (less than
40%0 of total cannabinoids). The lower THC group was twice as frequent as the
other group. Earliness of flowering, number of flowers, and height characteristics
were intermediate between the parents.
The taxonomy of Cannabis has assumed importance with the spread of mari-
juana as a drug of abuse, because most state and federal laws are written in
terms of only one species, Cannabis sativa L. The supposed existence of more
than one species in the genus has caused considerable legal difficulty. At least
one article (Fullerton & Kurzman, 1974) has been written providing an arsenal
of information that has proved successful in achieving acquitals in marijuana
possession cases. Generally the Prosecution is forced to prove which species has
been confiscated to determine if the law has actually been violated.
Much work has been done from a morphological point of view on Cannabis
taxonomy. The history of the original botanical literature has been reviewed in
detail (Emboden, 1974; Schultes et al., 1974). A large variety of freshly grown
specimens have been examined, both for morphology (Small & Cronquist, 1976)
and chemistry (Small et al., 1975; Fetterman et al., 1971). Three species have
been delineated by Schultes et al. (1974), namely C. sativa L., C. indica Lam.
and C. ruderalis Janisch. They have published a key for the differentiation of
these three species based on height, branching, seed coat marbling, and seed
attachment and its abscission layer.
Other investigators have held to the traditional monotypic concept (Small &
Cronquist, 1976), holding that the wide variations in such characters and others
are simply due to the inherent plasticity of the species. Most phytochemical
studies have revealed Ino major differences in the content and quality of canna-
binoids (other than the ratio of cannabidiol to tetrahydrocannabinol) that could
serve to differentiate species. Other chemical markers of taxonomic significance
have not been found.
Both chemical and morphological studies have been essentially static studies
of a genetically dynamic organism, with little experimental attention given to the
genetics on which the taxonomic characters are based.
In an attempt to clarify the taxonomic situation, and to elucidate the genetics
of cannabinoid production, we have carried out preliminary cross-breeding ex-
periments between Cannabis sativa L. and Cannabis ruderalis Janisch. under
greenhouse conditions with the plants in reproductive isolation from other strains.
Such a cross has been noted in the wild (R. E. Schultes, pers. comm., 1977) but
was not included in the work of Small (1972) who intercrossed 38 strains of
Cannabis, and found all strains to be interfertile.

FIG. 1. Biosynthesis of cannabinoids (after Shoyama et al., 1974).
Recent advances in the understanding of cannabinoid biosynthesis have made
possible more meaningful experiments with the plant. Shoyama et al. (1974) have
elegantly elucidated the biosynthetic pathway to the cannabinoid acids from mev-
alonate, acetate, and malonate. These are well recognized as the true biosynthetic
products of the plant (Fig. 1). Many of the minor cannabinoids isolated have
come to be seen as degradation products of the natural cannabinoids on storage,
exposure to light, curing, and other processing. Small & Cronquist's work
(1976) and the work of Fetterman et al. in Mississippi (1971) have strengthened
the view that THC-acid production is more dependent on the genome of the
plant than on environmental factors.
Our breeding experiments were designed to take a closer look at the breeding
behavior of the plant with respect to cannabinoid production, measured by gas
chromatographic techniques, and backed up by mass spectral identification of the
gas chromatographic peaks as cannabinoids.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seed samples.-JBC-2 was obtained from the Central Siberian Botanical Gar-
den, Novosibirsk, USSR, and labelled Cannabis ruderalis. This is possibly iden-
tical to the C. ruderalis in Small & Beckstead (1973, p. 164, Table 5). It produced
small (less than 2 ft) quick-flowering plants with low THC content (less than 0.2%).
The seeds were marbled and dropped off at maturity, and the "fleshy caruncle-
like growth at the base" was evident, though not obviously so.
JBC-3 was an alledgedly Mexican strain of C. sativa which reached 6-7 ft in
height when given adequate root space, did not flower until it had reached this
height, and contained a relatively high amount of THC (between 1.0 and 2.0WO).
Seeds were plain and indehiscent at maturity. Despite the lack of an authentic
origin for this strain, it conforms to all published criteria for C. sativa.
Growing conditions.-Seeds were sown in rows in flats containing two parts
of topsoil to one part peat moss. The greenhouse was kept between 700 and 80?F.
When several inches tall, the seedlings were transplanted to large plastic tubs 16
inches in diameter and eight inches deep, a size that was found to minimally
restrict growth. Smaller pots were not used because this produced smaller plants
of C. sativa, disguising useful differences in growth and flowering behavior.

Plants were watered twice daily by an automatic capillary watering system, and
positioned to receive full sun in the greenhouse.
The time of sowing was not strictly controlled with regard to day-length, how-
ever the quickness of flowering was constant within the plants of each strain used
in the cross. The Mexican strain (JBC-3) has shown erratic flowering behavior
when grown out of step with the normal seasonal variations in day-length. The
Cannabis ruderalis (JBC-2) flowered promptly when sown at any point from
November to May. Convenience dictated that plants of the two strains not be
started at the same time, due to the difference in time required for flower pro-
duction.
Plants were harvested when mature; i.e., for males, after the pollen had been
substantially shed; and for females, after sufficient ripe seed had been collected
for further breeding work. All samples analyzed were freeze-dried and stored in
the dark in sealed plastic bags at room temperature.
Sampling protocols varied, especially for the Mexican strain, but all parts of
the same plant contained identical cannabinoid profiles if they contained any at
all. Roots and woody stems did not contain cannabinoids, and leaves contained
less than the flowering tops. All C. ruderalis plants were analyzed as the whole
freeze-dried plant. Where several very small individuals were concerned, several
of the same sex and age were combined into the same sample.
Gas chromatography.-The procedure used was based on that of Lerner
(1969). One g of plant material was shaken with 40 ml of chloroform at room
temperature for one hour in a stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. The solution was
filtered, the plant material rinsed with a few ml of chloroform, and the combined
solution evaporated under reduced pressure. This residue was taken up first in
2.0 ml of chloroform, and then 2.0 ml of the internal standard solution (5.0 mg/ml
androstene-3,17-dione in methanol) was added. This solution was stored in screw-
capped vials with teflon inserts in the caps at freezer temperatures. Caps without
teflon inserts were leached by both methanol and chloroform. Dioctyl phthalate
from the cap leachates was found to have a relative retention time of 0.45, which
without mass spectral analysis could be confused with A-8-THC.
Sample solutions were injected on a 3% OV-17 on 100/120 Gas Chrom Q column
(Supelco, Inc.) 6 ft long, 4 mm i.d., installed in an HCl Scientific gas chromato-
graph, or Varian model 3700 gas chromatograph, both with flame ionization de-
tection. Injector temperature was 255?C, column temperature isothermal at 220?C,
carrier gas flow (He) 120 ml/min. Typically one microliter of sample solution was
injected.
Peak areas were determined by multiplying height times half-height width. This
was compared to the area of the internal standard peak and corrected for the
amount of plant material taken, along with the response factor of each compound.
It should be noted that this procedure does not differentiate between canna-
bidiol (CBD) and cannabichromene (CBC) (RRT-0.36) (Turner et al., 1975). To
ascertain the identity of this peak, gas chromatography at 180?C on a 3 % OV-
101 column was performed. The results of this separation were used to get the
ratio of CBD to CBC in the combined peak on OV-17.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemistry.-The results of glc analysis are presented in Figure 2 as total per-
cent cannabinoids on a dry weight basis versus A9-THC as percent of total can-
nabinoids (CBD, CBC, Y9-THC). This method of expressing cannabinoid content
gives a comparison of overall production of cannabinoids, as well as an indication
of how much of this cannabinoid production is A9-THC. The percentage of CBC

was found to be relatively constant within the experiment, from 3 to 9 % of total
cannabinoids in the progeny. Parent strains also had CBC as a non-variable can-
nabinoid at about the same concentration. Thus CBD and THC are the important
variables in the cross. The total percent cannabinoids varies rather widely due
to variation in sampling technique, but the pattern of cannabinoid production can
be delimited into two groups for the cross.
The parent strain JBC-3 (C. sativa) is seen to contain at least 70% THC of total
cannabinoids. The sex appears to make no difference in cannabinoid total or
pattern in this strain.
The other parent, JBC-2 (C. ruderalis), contains less than 40%o THC of total
cannabinoids, with most plants falling below the 20o level. The total percent
cannabinoids was lower for C. ruderalis (x = 0.45%) than for C. sativa (I -
1.61%), though one "sport" of JBC-2, which was kept for several weeks under
high humidity conditions (an inverted paper chromatography tank), showed 1.54%
total cannabinoids on a whole plant sample. The sport's cannabinoid pattern was
similar to others of its strain, however. The variation in sampling methods makes
statistical comparison of the means impossible.
The offspring of the cross were from the female C. sativa. The female C.
ruderalis plants were weak, and though they set seed, the number was small and
of poor viability. The seedlings either did not germinate or did not survive much
beyond germination. The fact that the reverse cross produced vigorous offspring,
and that cannabinoid production does not seem to be linked to sex [in some
strains it is linked, according to Small et al. (1975)], means that failure to generate
offspring was due to generally weak plants and not to a lack of interfertility.
The progeny of the cross fell into two groups (Fig. 3), separated by a large gap
in THC percentage. The total cannabinoid percent of dry weight ranged between
0.36% and 1.30%, with a mean of 0.72% for each group taken separately. All but
one value was less than L.0%. This high value was for the top of a plant selected
for a voucher herbarium specimen, not for a whole plant. This underlines the
importance of sampling procedure, which will be discussed in detail below.

TOTAL PER CENT CANNABINOIDS
FIG. 3. Cannabinoid profiles for progeny (Cannabis sativ'a x ruderalis).
One-third of the progeny (n = 5, 3 females, 2 males) had THC percentages
over 60W of total cannabinoids. The other two-thirds of the progeny (n = 10, 6
females, 3 males, one died before flowering) had THC percentages between 30
and 40Wo of total cannabinoids.
This rather conspicuous chemical dimorphism has no easy genetic explanation.
It does not seem to be a case of one enzyme being responsible for the cyclization
of cannabidiolic acid to THCA. And if it were that simple, no such "cannabidiolic
acid cyclase" has ever been isolated from Cannabis of any species.
Morphology.-In habit, the progeny resembled both parents to some extent.
They did not show the dimorphism seen in cannabinoid content. Plants were
between one and two ft tall, grew vigorously on germination, and flowered after
putting out several pairs of true leaves. They continued their growth after initial
flowering. The plants were self-crossed to produce an F2 generation of seed,
which was saved for further plantings.
Some of the F1 seeds were slower to germinate than their C. sativa parent.
Four seeds remained in the flat for four months before germination. These plants
were analyzed when mature, and their cannabinoid profiles fell within either of
the two groups of progeny. Delay in germination is characteristic of plants grow-
ing outside of cultivation, either in a wild or weedy state. This trait was presum-
ably transmitted from the C. ruderalis parent, although it was not observed in
the seeds sown.
A voucher specimen of one of the female progeny has been deposited in the
Library of Economic Botany of the Harvard Botanical Museum, as specimen no.

Such genetic inhomogeneity has not been reported before in strains of Can-
nabis. The nearest case is that of South African Cannabis reported by Boucher
et al. (1977), in which they found the presence of two chemotypes varying in
amounts of THCA and the C3 THCA homolog tetrahydrocannabivarolic acid.
Small et al.'s breeding experiments (1975) reported only that progeny obtained
in crosses were "intermediate" in cannabinoid content. The aim of chemotaxon-
omy is to demonstrate that the variation in chemistry between two populations has
a genetic basis dependent on the presence or absence of enzymes involved with
the biosynthesis of the compounds in question. Such information cannot be gotten
from studies where populations are pooled or samples are not uniform. In order
to do more meaningful work on individual plant cannabinoid content, it is nec-
essary to find sampling methods which are not subject to wide variations, and
which are precisely definable and reproducible.
Sampling.-We propose that the unit of sampling for female Cannabis plants
be the mature bract, at the point where the seed is no longer green and is easily
separable from the bract. For the male plant, perhaps the pollen can be used. It
has been found in this and other studies (Paris et al., 1975) to contain the same
proportions of cannabinoids as the rest of the plant. The male flower is less
reproducible for sampling, since it is continuously shedding pollen at maturity,
thereby changing the relative proportions of pollen and flower tissue.
This involves working with rather small amounts, since a mature bract when
fresh weighs only about 2 mg. Pollen is most easily collected in milligram quan-
tities. But the technique makes possible reproducible multiple samplings from
each plant.
As an example of the technique, single fresh bracts were put into a 4 ml screw-
capped vial with 0.1 ml of chloroform overnight at room temperaature. In the
morning 0.1 ml more of chloroform was added, along with 20 microliters of a
methanolic solution of the internal standard, androstene-dione at a concentration
of 1 mg/ml. The sample solution was injected into the glc as with the whole plant
assay.
Results for this type of assay done with single bracts from the progeny of our
cross indicate that the method gives comparable results to the whole plant assay
for the percentage of cannabinoids. The percent total of cannabinoids is higher
than for the whole plant, as would be expected.
Assuming that the bracts are relatively uniform within the same plant, how
does this sampling method compare with other methods, such as the whole plant,
or the manicured plant? The wholS plant analysis involves parts (seeds, roots,
and woody stems) which have little if any cannabinoid content. The relative
proportion of these parts to leaf and bract varies widely with cultural conditions;
e.g., if the plant is grown under dry conditions, the root will become a very short,
stocky structure, with few branchings; but if it is grown with adequate moisture
it will be longer, thinner, and branched with many fine rootlets that are hard to
collect completely. The amount of stem and vegetative growth varies also with
plant nutrition.
These factors induce error in the measurement of the plant's actual genetic
capacity to produce cannabinoids, while having nothing to do with cannabinoid
production. Cannabinoids and their precursors are formed entirely in the leafy
portions of the plant (Crombie & Crombie, 1975).
The bract, assuming the flower is pollinated, is the most stable part of the plant
both for morphology and for sampling.
The number of flowers produced on a plant will influence the relative levels
between the bract sampling method and the whole plant assay. We have observed
within the progeny of the cross a variation in the number of flowers produced

per plant. This is reasonable because Cannabis has been bred for higher seed and
flower production. The Mexican parent produces seed quite heavily, while the
presumably wild C. ruderalis produces relatively few seeds, concentrating its
energies into the production of fewer, more viable seeds. This difference in char-
acters shows its genetic base by its mixed transmission into the offspring of the
cross.
An aim of taxonomy is to find independent, definable characters, based where
possible on a single gene system. The two traits of cannabinoid production and
number of flowers per plant are mixed using a whole or manicured plant assay,
but not in a bract assay, because the proportion of dry weight due to high can-
nabinoid bracts is greater for many-seeded varieties of Cannabis than it is for
those producing relatively few seeds.
The cellular locus of cannabinoid biosynthesis is not known at present. It has
been found that it does not occur exclusively in the glandular hairs, that at least
the number of glandular hairs on the bract surface does not correlate positively
with cannabinoid content (Turner et al., 1977). Thus, it is likely that the site of
cannabinoid biosynthesis is spread throughout the cells of the epidermis of the
bracts and leaves, as well as in the cells of the glandular hairs.
If the site of cannabinoid biosynthesis were the glandular hairs, the most re-
producible assay for cannabinoid production would involve the isolation of the
hairs. This has been done for a member of the Lamiaceae (Croteau, 1977). Num-
ber of glandular hairs would then be a second character not controlled by can-
nabinoid biosynthetic ability. Since the hairs are not the specific locus of biosyn-
thesis, the most specific assay should choose a definable unit of epidermis, and
this unit of epidermis is the bract. The leaves vary in size and would be hard to
define precisely for sampling. The bract is less variable, if the age on sampling
(maturity of the seed) is specified.
This technique is useful for herbarium specimens, with the advantage of dis-
turbing valuable voucher specimens less than other methods.
We would suggest that this method be adopted in further studies of Cannabis
breeding and cannabinoid biosynthesis. We intend to use it in the extension of
the present experiment using botanically validated stocks of Cannabis sativa, C.
indica, and C. ruderalis under more tightly controlled breeding conditions and
using standard plant breeding formats, with more detailed attention to individual
crosses. The F2 generation of the present cross will be followed to see if its
cannabinoid content is different from the F1.
Other compounds (terpenes, flavonoids) will be examined for their utility as
biochemical "markers. "
SUMMARY
The results of this experiment strengthen the evidence that the cannabinoid
content of Cannabis species is genetically controlled, and would suggest a search
for the enzyme or enzyme system responsible for "cannabidiolic acid cyclase"
activity. Feeding experiments with radiolabelled CBDA and tissue homogenate
fractions could result in the isolation of such an entity. This might in turn lead
to the elucidation of a specific enzyme inhibitor which would block high potency
strains from producing THC.
The experiments also indicate that C. sativa and C. ruderalis are interfertile
under greenhouse conditions, and that the cannabinoid profiles, while differing
in the amount of cannabinoid predominating, show no novel cannabinoids. This
is one piece of evidence supporting the view that Cannabis is a monotypic genus.
More studies are indicated to explore this further, particularly to note if other

specific biochemically significant chemotaxonomic markers (e.g., essential oils,
flavonoids) can be located which might lend validity to the polytypic concept.
