# 1.  Introduction
## 1.1  Background
Cannabis products are the most widely trafficked drugs worldwide, accounting for
65 per cent of all global seizure cases (1.65 million cases) in 2006. 5,200 metric tons
of herb and 1,000 metric tons of resin were seized in 2006. Practically all countries in
the world are affected by cannabis trafficking. Similarly, cannabis also remains the most
widely used drug worldwide, with an estimated 166 million people having used cannabis
in 2006, equivalent to some 4 per cent of the global population aged 15-64.
At the same time, especially since the end of the last century, production methods
have become increasingly sophisticated, resulting in the availability in illicit markets
of a wide range of cannabis products with widely varying levels of the main psycho-
active ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Most recently, there has also
been a renewed debate about increasing THC content (frequently referred to as
“potency”) in illicit cannabis products.
All of this requires analytical data which are comparable between laboratories and
over time. However, most countries do not require by law the detailed analysis of
the THC content of the different products, and where such analyses are carried out,
they use a variety of approaches and experimental designs, reducing the comparability
of results. For example, the conversion of natural constituents, such as tetrahydro-
cannabinolic acid (THCA), by both smoking and under certain analytical conditions
into THC, and how this should be reflected in the analytical report, are issues which
are not yet standardized worldwide. On the technological side, the analysis of
cannabis products is further complicated by the relatively restricted availability of
pure or well defined reference material of THC and other cannabinoids.*
The present manual is an updated and significantly revised version of the manual
on “Recommended methods for testing cannabis” (ST/NAR/8), which was published
in 1987. It has been prepared taking into account both developments in analytical
technology and advances in the science of cannabis, and with a view to providing
the analytical basis for an objective discussion about changes in THC content over
time, and differences between regions and products.
- In this connection, it is important to be aware that THC was fully characterized only in the mid-
1960s, and was only available as pure reference standard from the late 1960s. Results obtained before
that time therefore should not be compared with today’s results, and must be considered approximate.

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
## 1.2  Purpose and use of the manual
The present manual is one in a series of similar publications dealing with the iden-
tification and analysis of various types of drugs under international control. These
manuals are the outcome of a programme pursued by UNODC since the early 1980s,
aimed at the harmonization and establishment of recommended methods of analysis
for national drug analysis laboratories.
In line with the overall objective of the series, the present manual suggests approaches
that may assist drug analysts in the selection of methods appropriate to the sample
under examination and provide data suitable for the purpose at hand, leaving room
also for adaptation to the level of sophistication of different laboratories and the
various legal needs. The majority of methods included in the present manual are
validated methods, which have been used for a number of years in reputable labo-
ratories and as part of inter-laboratory studies, collaborative exercises and proficiency
tests. The reader should be aware, however, that there are a number of other methods,
including those published in the forensic science literature, which may also produce
acceptable results. Any new method that is about to be used in the reader’s
laboratory must be validated and/or verified prior to routine use.
In addition, there are a number of more sophisticated approaches, but they may not
be necessary for routine operational applications. Therefore, the methods described
here should be understood as guidance, that is, minor modifications to suit local
circumstances should not normally change the validity of the results. The choice of
the methodology and approach to analysis as well as the decision whether or not
additional methods are required remain with the analyst and may also be dependent
on the availability of appropriate instrumentation and the level of legally acceptable
proof in the jurisdiction within which the analyst works.
Attention is also drawn to the vital importance of the availability to drug analysts
of reference materials and books on drugs of abuse and analytical techniques. More-
over, the analyst must of necessity keep abreast of current trends in drug analysis,
consistently following current analytical and forensic science literature.

# 2.  Illicit production of cannabis
# products
## 2.1  Cannabis market
Cannabis products are by far the most abused drugs on the illicit drug market.
Cannabis can be grown in virtually any country, and is increasingly cultivated
indoors in technically advanced countries.
Production of herbal cannabis (marihuana) is widely dispersed, existing in almost
every country in the world. Cannabis resin (hashish) is produced in about 65 coun-
tries, with main sources being North Africa and countries in South-West Asia,
particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Africa is home to the world’s leading producer of (outdoor) cannabis resin—
Morocco, the site of the largest known cannabis cultivation area. Most of the
cannabis resin seized in Europe continues to be trafficked from Morocco. The resin
from that country shares characteristics with resin from other, southern and eastern
Mediterranean countries (see section 3.13.2.1).
Afghanistan is the world’s second largest producer of resin from cannabis, grown
alongside opium poppy fields. Resin from that country shares characteristics with
resin from other parts of the Indian subcontinent (see section 3.13.2.2). Lebanon
was once one of the world’s leading resin suppliers and might still be if it were not
for continued eradication efforts.
With regard to herbal cannabis, the American continent accounted for some
55 per cent of global production in 2006, followed by Africa (about 22 per cent).
Most herbal cannabis is produced for domestic markets and for export to neighbour-
ing countries, i.e. international trafficking in herbal cannabis is rather limited.
Since the 1970s, cannabis growers in North America and Europe have been working
to create more potent cannabis, and the market for high-potency, indoor-produced
sinsemilla (see section 3.6.1) is growing in many key consumption countries. Sin-
semilla potency has increased dramatically in the last decade in the United States,
Canada, and The Netherlands—the three countries at the vanguard of cannabis breed-
ing and production technology—and there are indications that its market share is
growing in many other countries.

However, there is no evidence that the effective potency* of cannabis on the Euro-
pean market has increased significantly. This is because in most European countries
imported cannabis (herbal and resin) continues to dominate the market and the
potency of these imported products has remained stable over many years at around
6-8  per  cent. The increase in cannabis potency observed in some countries since
the end of the 1990s is the result of the increased availability of home-produced
herbal cannabis, which is cultivated using high THC breeds and intensive hydroponic
techniques. Indoor cultivation of herbal cannabis now occurs in most, if not all,
European countries. However, despite this trend towards home-grown (indoor) culti-
vation in Europe, import of cannabis products from outdoor cultivation, mainly
cannabis resin, is still observed, especially in Central Europe [1, 2].
Limited time-series data on cannabis potency suggest that the mean ∆ 9 -THC concen-
tration in home-produced herbal cannabis seizures increased from around 1.5 per cent
in the 1980s to around 4 per cent in the late 1990s and around 10 per cent in the last
five years [3, 4]. Recent reports from some European countries suggest mean THC
concentrations (potency) of up to 15-20 per cent in certain herbal materials, but there
is significant variation between samples even within a given year [5, 6, 7, 8].
Although the high-potency indoor herbal cannabis has a higher THC content than
the cannabis resin from Morocco, the latter is still being sold in Europe and
considered by experienced cannabis users to produce a good high.
A more detailed and up-to-date overview of the worldwide production, trafficking
and use of cannabis can be found in the annual World Drug Reports published by
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [9].
- The term “effective potency” refers to the weighted mean potency of all cannabis products, taking
into account their relative availability.

# 3.  Description of the cannabis plant
# and illicit cannabis products
## 3.1  Name
Cannabis sativa L. (Linnaeus)
## 3.2  Synonyms
There are many local and street names and synonyms used for cannabis and it is
beyond the scope of this manual to list them all. They include: hemp, marihuana,
marijuana, pot, gandia, grass, chanvre and many more [10].
## 3.3  Taxonomy
The genera Cannabis and Humulus (hops) belong to the same family ( Cannabaceae ,
sometimes known as Cannabinaceae ). Generally, cannabis is considered to be mono-
specific ( Cannabis sativa L.) which is divided into several subspecies ( C. sativa
subsp. sativa , C. sativa subsp. indica , C. sativa subsp. ruderalis , C. sativa subsp.
spontanea , C. sativa subsp. kafiristanca ) [11]. However, the chemical and morpho-
logical distinctions by which cannabis has been split into these subspecies are often
not readily discernible, appear to be environmentally modifiable, and vary in a
continuous fashion. For most purposes, it will suffice to apply the name Cannabis
sativa to all cannabis plants encountered [12].
## 3.4  Physical appearance
Cannabis is an annual, dioecious,* flowering herb. Staminate (male) plants are
usually taller but less robust than pistillate (female) plants. Stems are erect and can
vary from 0.2-6 m. However, most of the plants reach heights of 1-3 m. The extent
of branching, like the plant height, depends on environmental and hereditary factors
as well as the method of cultivation (see also section 5.3.1).
- The majority of plants is dioecious (i.e. male and female flowers are found on separate plants),
although monoecious plants (i.e. bearing both male and female flowers) may also be encountered.

## 3.5  Similarities
Several plant species bear morphological characteristics that show more or less
resemblance to Cannabis sativa . Some of them are illustrated below. However, a
closer look at their macroscopic and/or microscopic characteristics makes confusion
very unlikely [12]. In addition, there are also simple presumptive tests available to
differentiate Cannabis sativa from other plant materials (see section 5.4.3).

Seeds of the common hop ( Humulus lupulus ) and Japanese hop ( Humulus japonicus )
might be confused with the seeds of Cannabis sativa . However, the presence of a
characteristic reticulate (“tortoise shell”) pattern on the surface of cannabis seeds
enables them to be identified readily.

## 3.6  Breeding
The plant is best suited to well structured neutral to alkaline clay and loam soils,
with good water-holding capacity, which are not subject to water logging.
Among many trials of breeding, crossing sativa and indica strains led to the develop-
ment of “skunk”, a hybrid said to be 75 per cent sativa and 25 per cent indica .

11
This strain is said to be one of the first which combines the high THC content of
C. sativa subsp. sativa with the rapid growth cycle and yield of C. sativa subsp.
indica . In some countries, cannabis with a high THC content is generally referred
to as “skunk” today.
3.6.1  Sinsemilla (Spanish for: “no seed”)
The term sinsemilla refers to a cultivation technique rather than a genetic strain.
Cannabis with the highest level of THC is comprised exclusively of the female
flower heads (“buds”) that remain unfertilized throughout maturity and which, con-
sequently, contain no seeds. The production of sinsemilla requires identifying the
female plants and ensuring that they are not exposed to pollen.
3.6.2  Cloning
The first and most obvious boost to sinsemilla production was the use of clones.
Cloning simply means propagating from a successful “mother” plant. This cutting
is rooted and transplanted. It is a genetic duplicate of its mother and thus can be
used to create even more cuttings. A square metre of mother plants can provide
numerous clones a week.
3.6.3  Artificially induced hermaphrodites
Although genetics disposes a plant to become male or female, environmental factors,
including the diurnal light cycle, can alter the sex (hermaphrodites). Natural herma-
phrodites with both male and female parts are usually sterile, but artificially induced
hermaphrodites can have fully functional reproductive organs. “Feminized” seeds
sold by many commercial seed suppliers are gained from artificially hermaphroditic
females that lack the male chromosome or by treating the seeds with hormones or
silver thiosulfate. Thus, production of only pistillate (female) plants can be achieved
by seed as well [17,18].
3.6.4  Outdoor production
The main production of cannabis worldwide is still outdoors and these plants are
generally but not necessarily grown from seeds.
Outdoor sinsemilla production is realized by identifying and destroying male plants
before pollination or by the use of artificially induced hermaphroditic females (see
section 3.6.3).

3.6.5  Indoor production
Growing cannabis from seed means that half of the crop might be unwanted male
plants. For cost-intensive greenhouse production this is usually avoided, which
can be achieved easily by cloning. Cloning and indoor production go hand in
hand. Indoor production is mainly encountered in technologically advanced coun-
tries, where big basements or closed factories are usually used. One or more
rooms in houses or other dwellings are also frequently converted into grow rooms
often using hydroponic techniques, i.e. growing plants in nutrient solutions instead
of soil.
In soil, the optimum pH for the plant is 6.5 to 7.2. In hydroponic growing, the
nutrient solution is best at 5.2 to 5.8, making cannabis well-suited to hydroponics,
and thus indoor production, because this pH range is hostile to most bacteria and
fungi [19].
An example and overview of trends in illicit cannabis cultivation in the United Kingdom,
including relevant legal and forensic implications, can be found in [20].
## 3.7  Industrial cannabis
Industrial cannabis (industrial hemp) comprises a number of varieties of Cannabis
sativa L. that are intended for agricultural and industrial purposes. They are grown
for their seeds and fibres. Industrial cannabis is characterized by low THC content
and high cannabidiol (CBD) content. In most European countries the current upper
legal limit for cultivation is 0.2 per cent THC (Canada: 0.3 per cent). The ratio of
CBD to THC is greater than one.
In many countries, “lists of approved cultivars” exist. Varieties which are consistently
found to exceed the legally acceptable levels for THC may be removed from these
lists.
Harvesting for fibres occurs at the end of flowering of the female plants and before
seed formation.
## 3.8  Flowering
Flowering usually starts when darkness exceeds eleven hours per day. The flowering
cycle can last anywhere between four and twelve weeks, depending on the strain
and environmental conditions. Flowering times given by seed companies usually
refer to the time taken to flower when grown from seed. Plants grown from cuttings
can take a week or so longer to finish flowering.

## 3.9  Harvesting
A good sign of ripeness is the colour of the hair-like structures (stigmas). As each
flower ripens, these usually shrivel and turn brown. When about 75 per cent of the
stigmas are brown, the plants are ready to harvest.
## 3.10  Yield
Mean and/or minimal yield estimates are of forensic and legal interest. However, yield
estimates are difficult, strongly dependent on cultivar/breed, cultivation technique,
nutrition, light intensity, duration and rhythm, etc. Studies undertaken in Australia and
New Zealand have shown that yields from indoor and outdoor grown plants are so
variable that it is not meaningful to apply a set formula for wet : dry : saleable
material or grams per plant or square metre.*
Nevertheless, some empirical studies are available and summarized below. Variations
due to different cultivation factors as mentioned above have to be considered.
Studies in Germany, The Netherlands and from EUROPOL are reported as follows:

## 3.11 ∆ 9 -THC distribution in cannabis plants and
## products [26]
The THC content* varies depending on the plant part:
10-12 per cent
in pistillate flowers
1-2 per cent
in leaves
0.1-0.3 per cent
in stalks
< 0.03 per cent
in the roots
The THC content of the different cannabis products (herb, resin and oil) is the result
of the ratio of the different plant parts used in their production. A study in Switzerland
in 2006 showed, for example, that two thirds of seizures of herbal cannabis ranged
between 2  per  cent and 12  per  cent THC. Two thirds of the resin seizures ranged
between 4  per  cent and 21  per  cent, depending on details of the cultivation and
production method (see also chapter 3.13.2), while extraction of resin and/or flower-
ing tops can result in cannabis oil with a THC content of up to 60 per cent [27].
For more information on THC contents of cannabis products seized worldwide see
also UNODC’s annual World Drug Reports [9].
## 3.12  Biosynthesis
It was until recently presumed that tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, the precur-
sor of THC) is formed by cyclization of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Newer studies
give evidence that it is actually formed from cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) through
oxidocyclization by the enzyme THCA-synthase [28, 29, 30, 31].
CBGA is the precursor for THCA as well as for CBDA and for cannabichromenic
acid (CBCA). The corresponding THC, CBD and cannabichromene (CBC) are
generated by decarboxylation.
Cannabinol (CBN) is a degradation product of THC, i.e. it does not occur naturally,
but is an artefact. (see also chapter 3.14)
## 3.13  Cannabis products
Cannabis has been used as an agricultural crop for textile fibres for centuries. Other
legitimate cannabis products include cannabis seed, cannabis seed oil and the essen-
tial oil of cannabis.
-  Figures about THC content refer to “total content” (see section 5.4.1).

Illicit cannabis products fall into three main categories: herbal cannabis, cannabis
resin and liquid cannabis (cannabis oil). It must be stressed that no two illicit
cannabis products have identical physical appearances. Produced from a highly
variable natural product using a batch process capable of wide variation, and
subsequently subjected to processing and transformation for trafficking purposes,
cannabis products appear in illicit markets in a multitude of forms.
3.13.1  Herbal cannabis
It is still the traditional belief that only the fruiting and flowering tops and leaves
next to the flowering tops contain significant quantities of the psychoactive consti-
tuent (THC); they are known as the “drug-containing parts”, and generally it is only
these parts of the plant that are sold in the illicit market (B in figure 1, page 8).
Indeed, these parts contain the highest amount of THC. However, illicitly consumed
herbal cannabis also includes bigger leaves located at greater distance from the
flowering tops.
Also the leaves next to the male flowering tops of potent cannabis plants contain
consumable amounts of THC. However, the content is much lower than that for
female plants and they are therefore not material of first choice. The central stem
and main side stems contain little THC but they may still be used in the production
of cannabis oil.
The dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant are known as “marihuana”, and
a plethora of other regional names exist [10]. “Marihuana” is found in the illegal
market unchanged, i.e. raw from the plant (also called “dried flower”), processed
as compressed slabs or coins, or as ground up material. The presentation of the
herbal material in illicit markets varies widely, from region to region as well as
within the countries of each region.
High quality product can be made by sieving crushed herbal cannabis to remove
those parts of the plant which contain relatively low levels of, or no, cannabinoids.
Essentially, this removes seeds and all but the most insignificant stem material. All
that passes through the sieving process has been derived from the flowering and
fruiting tops’ herbal material, therefore a relative enrichment of THC occurs. In the
illicit traffic, the product is known as “Kif”. It is a characteristic product of North
Africa. Such material has high cannabis resin content and can be compressed into
slabs, which bear some physical resemblance to cannabis resin slabs (hashish). How-
ever, when subjected to microscopic examination, such slabs are found to have
retained essential herbal characteristics (see also section 5.3.2), and are considered
a sort of “purified marihuana”.
A third, and in some western European countries dominant, way of producing high
quality herbal cannabis is indoor production. Very potent hybrids such as “skunk”,

“white widow”, etc. are generally used and cultivation conditions are optimized.
Propagation occurs mainly by cloning of the mother plants (see section 3.6.2);
seedlings are seldom encountered anymore. Premises used for indoor cultivation
include basements, factories, warehouses and unused portions of commercial or
industrial facilities. They are often equipped with automated nutrition and water
supply, air conditioning, systems to filter and deodorize outlet air and automated
illumination to mimic day and night phases. The combination of ideal growing
conditions and high THC cultivars generates products with a maximum THC content
which is often two to ten times higher than that observed in the late eighties. Herbal
cannabis with a total THC content of more than 10  per  cent, cannabis resin with
25 per cent THC and cannabis oil with 60 per cent THC are not unusual today.
The drying process is simple. Either the drug-containing parts are cut off or the
entire plant is suspended upside down and air-dried. Drying is complete when the
leaves next to flowering tops are brittle. Depending on the humidity and ambient
temperature, this takes approximately 24 to 72 hours. The residual water-content in
this material is about 8-13 per cent. This material is directly suitable for smoking
in a joint and can be stored for many months, although THC degrades with time,
when exposed to air, light and humidity.
3.13.2  Cannabis resin (hashish)
The resinous secretions of the plant, produced in the glandular trichomes (see sec-
tion 5.3.2) can be collected, thus obtaining a higher THC-containing product from
which most recognizable plant material is removed. In addition to the secretions, it
consists of finer plant material and appears as loose or pressed sticky powder,
depending on the method of production.
Worldwide, the production of cannabis resin is centred in two main regions. The
countries around the southern and the eastern part of the Mediterranean form one
region, and the countries in South and South-West Asia form another. A variety of
processes have been used in both regions to produce cannabis resin. However, in
general, the countries of one region use similar techniques. Sieving is an important
part of the process in both regions.
3.13.2.1  Cannabis resin from Mediterranean countries
In this region, the dried herbal material is typically threshed. Threshing, which is
often carried out against a wall, is done to separate the resin-producing parts of the
plant. Particles of cannabis resin and fragments of cannabis leaves, as well as
cannabis seeds, become detached from the more fibrous parts of the plant. The latter
are discarded. The material is then sieved to remove seeds and major fibrous parts.
The resulting product is now enriched in resin content and therefore in THC. At
this stage, macroscopic botanical characteristics are virtually absent, but microscopi-
cally the material still exhibits many botanical traits. Physically, it resembles a fine

17
sticky powder and, at this stage, it is usually compressed into slabs. Sometimes a
logo, which can be used for characterization and comparison, is stamped into the
slabs. In some countries (eastern Mediterranean) the material is placed in cloth bags
prior to compression, while in other locations (North Africa) cellulose wrapping is
added before compression. In the north-eastern Mediterranean and Central Europe,
the fine sticky powder is occasionally trafficked without having been compressed
into slabs.
3.13.2.2  Cannabis resin from South and South-West Asia
A different approach to the production of cannabis resin is known to be used in
South and South-West Asian countries. The fruiting and flowering tops of the can-
nabis plants grown there contain high levels of resin to an extent that makes these
parts of the plant very sticky to the touch. When the fruiting and flowering tops of
a fresh plant are rubbed between the palms of the hand, the resin is transferred from
the plant to the palm. An alternative approach is to rub the sticky parts against
rubber sheeting or to walk through a field of cannabis plants wearing rubber sheet-
ing or leather. Resin accumulates on the surface as it brushes against the fruiting
and flowering tops of the plant; when sufficient material has been collected, the
sheeting or leather may be scraped clean, and the material is compressed into slabs.
The above described technique can be applied to the uncut plants in the fields.
Alternatively, the flowering and fruiting tops may be collected in a similar way to
that used in herbal cannabis production, allowed to dry, and then be broken and
crushed between the hands into a coarse powder. This powder is then passed through
sieves so that it attains fineness similar to that obtained in the Mediterranean region.
The fine powder, which is still green, is stored in leather bags for four to five
months. The powder is then exposed to the sun for a short time—sufficient for the
resin to melt. It is put back into the leather bags for a few days, after which it is
removed and kneaded well with wooden rods so that a certain amount of oily
material appears on its surface. Kneading is continued until a material suitable for
pressing into slabs has been produced.
A fundamentally different method, also known to have been used in some South
and South-West Asian localities, involves immersion of the plant material, apart
from the main stems, in boiling water. This removes the resin from the fruiting and
flowering tops. The plant material which has been extracted is discarded and when
the extracting liquid cools, a layer of solidified resin forms on its surface. The resin
is removed and formed into slabs or whatever shape is favoured. The problem with
this method is that water is introduced into the resin. This results in the slabs of
resin frequently turning mouldy as they age. By quantity, little cannabis resin is
made in this more elaborate way.
3.13.2.3  Cannabis resin from “pollinators” / “ice-o-lators”
Together with the indoor cultivation, an efficient method of separating the resin has
been developed. A device comparable to a tumble-dryer lined with a finely woven

---
*[Pagina 26]*

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
net is placed in a box, lined with plastic. This so-called “pollinator” is partly filled
with dried and deep-frozen flowering and fruiting tops of the cannabis plant. Low
temperature reduces the stickiness of the resin. During rotation of the pollinator, the
THC-bearing parts of the leaves and flowering tops break and pass through the net.
They stick to the plastic walls and floor and can be collected as a fine powder.
Compared to the starting dried material, an up to 8-fold enrichment in THC can be
achieved with this procedure.
A similar method is used to produce so called “ice hash”, in which the dried plant
material is put in a coarse sieve with ice cubes and then agitated using a mechanical
paint stirrer. The ice causes the resin balls to freeze and drop off the plant. The
process is repeated for a series of progressively more finely-meshed sieves until a
powdered product similar to the above is achieved.
3.13.3  Liquid cannabis (hashish oil)
Liquid cannabis is a concentrated liquid extract of either herbal cannabis material or
of cannabis resin. The reason for the production of liquid cannabis is to concentrate
the psychoactive ingredient, THC. This may help traffickers evade interdiction,
because more psychoactive material can be contained in a smaller quantity of product.
Of equal value to the trafficker is the ability to insert the liquid cannabis into any
cavity and to use concealments which cannot easily accommodate herbal or resin
cannabis, thereby reducing the possibility of detection by the form or odour of the
material.
Extraction is performed in a suitable vessel with an organic solvent (e.g. petroleum
ether, ethanol, methanol, acetone) at room temperature with stirring, by passive
extraction or under reflux.

When the batch of cannabis or cannabis resin is thought to be fully extracted, the
suspension is filtered and the extracted material is discarded. If necessary, a second
fresh batch of cannabis material may be placed into the vessel and extracted with
the same batch of solvent used for the initial extraction. This process can be repeated
as often as required, using a number of batches of cannabis or cannabis resin with
a single batch of extracting solvent. After the final batch has been extracted, the
solvent is evaporated to obtain the required consistency of the oil. In some clandes-
tine laboratories, especially in those countries where organic solvents are expensive
or difficult to purchase, the excess solvent may be recovered for future use.
In general, liquid cannabis, whether made from cannabis or cannabis resin, is dark
brown or dark green in colour and has the consistency of thick oil or a paste.
3.13.4  Cannabis seeds and cannabis seed oil
Cannabis seeds are a less well known though potent source of Ω -3-fatty acids. Can-
nabis seed oil is a clear yellow liquid. The seed contain approximately 29 per cent to
34 per cent oil by weight [33]. 100 g of cannabis seed oil contains about 19 g α -linolenic
acid. A ratio of about 3:1 of Ω -6- to Ω -3-fatty acids makes cannabis seed oil a high
quality nutrient. However, due to its high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, this
oil tends to get rancid rapidly if not stored in a cool and dark place.
Although the seed is enclosed by the bracteole, which is the part of the plant with
the highest density of glandular trichomes and thus the highest THC concentration,
the seeds themselves do not contain THC. However, they may be contaminated with
cannabis materials (e.g. flowering tops, husks, resin), resulting in detectable amounts
of THC. Similarly, if THC is detected in cannabis seed oil, it most likely originated
from a poor separation of the seeds from the bract [34].
3.13.5  Cannabis essential oil
The essential oil of cannabis is a clear and slightly yellow-coloured liquid. It is
obtained by steam distillation of the freshly cut cannabis plants. A great demand
for this essential oil does not exist and it seems that it is rather a side product from
seed oil or hashish-oil production. The essential oil does not contain THC, but is
responsible for the characteristic smell of cannabis products, and is also the basis
for their identification by sniffer dogs.
## 3.14  Estimation of the age of cannabis samples
CBN does not exist in freshly and carefully dried marihuana. If it is present, the
sample is understood to have started to degrade and should not be used for

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
comparative purposes. It is feasible to estimate the age of a given marihuana sample
on the basis of its THC and CBN content, assuming storage was carried out at room
temperature. It is for this reason that analysis for comparative purposes is generally
not carried out more than three months after sample seizure [35].
THC appears to degrade at a higher rate for the first year than for subsequent years.
One study suggests that samples with a ratio of CBN to THC of less than 0.013
are less than six months old, and those with a ratio between 0.04 and 0.08 are
between one and two years old. However variations from experimental conditions
should be considered when using this approach to estimate the age of cannabis
samples [36].
## 3.15  Drug-type versus fibre-type cannabis
As has been described in section 3.7, the total THC content is used to define fibre-
type cannabis (cf. the current upper legal limit for industrial hemp of 0.2 per cent
THC and 0.3  per  cent THC, respectively, in Europe and Canada). Another simple
way of distinguishing between drug-type and fibre-type cannabis is by using the
ratio of the main cannabinoids THC, CBN and CBD [37].
As described above in section 3.12, both CBD and THC, via their acids CBDA
and THCA, are derived biosynthetically from CBGA. If the peak area ratio* of
[THC+CBN] : [CBD] is <1, then the cannabis plant is considered to be a fibre-type.
If the ratio is >1, it is considered a drug-type. Because THC is oxidized partly to
CBN after cutting and drying the plant material, the sum of the peak area of THC
and CBN is used and divided by the area of CBD.

# 5.  Qualitative and quantitative
# analysis of cannabis products
## 5.1  Sampling
The principal reason for a sampling procedure is to permit an accurate and mean-
ingful chemical analysis. Because most methods—qualitative and quantitative—used
in forensic science laboratories for the analysis of drugs require very small aliquots
of material, it is vital that these small aliquots be representative of the bulk from
which they have been drawn. Sampling should conform to the principles of analyti-
cal chemistry, as laid down, for example, in national pharmacopoeias or by regional
or international organizations [38].
There may be situations where, for legal reasons, the normal rules of sampling and
homogenization cannot be followed. This may happen if, for example, the analyst
wishes to preserve some part of an exhibit as visual evidence in court. For compressed
slabs, it is also important to ensure that the entire block is composed of cannabis.
This is achieved by prising open the block and examining the material closely.
To preserve valuable resources and time, forensic laboratories should seek, on all
possible occasions, to use an approved sampling system and thereby reduce the
number of quantitative determinations needed.
To facilitate such an approach, the procedures below are recommended. They are
based on the sampling procedure recommended by the European Union for outdoor
cannabis plantations for industrial hemp [39] and have been adapted to take into
account the practical aspects and variety of cannabis products in the illicit market.
5.1.1  Sampling of plants (indoor and outdoor plantations)
For each cannabis field—visually considered to be of the same species—30 fruiting
or flowering tops, one per plant, randomly chosen, not from the border of the field,
are cut to a length of about 20 cm and stored in a paper bag. For identification
purposes (qualitative analysis), the sampling of one representative plant in the
described manner is usually considered sufficient.*
-  See example of a hemp field given in reference 38 in relation to the comparison of the hypergeo-
metric and Bayesian methods.

Figure 5.  Sampling fruiting tops of the Cannabis plant
Wherever possible, the sample should be dried before sending to the laboratory. If
it has to be stored for any reason before being analysed, it should be kept in the
dark and cool.
Once dried, the degradation of the main cannabinoids is stopped. However, at this
stage THC is still sensitive to air (oxygen) and UV light, which oxidize THC to
CBN. Therefore, the preferred storage conditions are in the dark and cool.
5.1.2  Sampling of seized cannabis products
For general aspects of qualitative sampling of multi-unit samples, reference 38 can
be consulted. For material with obvious external characteristics, i.e. material all
recognizable as cannabis, a sampling method based on the Bayes’ model may be
preferred over the hypergeometric approach.
5.1.2.1  Herbal cannabis
In the illegal market, a huge variety of herbal cannabis products is encountered,
including loose plant material, or in the form of “dry flowers”, “sachets”, or “herbal
tea”. As described in the previous section, 30 pieces considered to belong to the
same phenotype are taken as one sample. If there is less material, all is taken. Coarse
stem material is cut off. Seeds in the fruiting tops remain in the exhibit.
Moist material has to be packaged in paper bags. For dried material plastic bags are
suitable.
5.1.2.2  Cannabis resin
The cannabis resin can be taken as it is. The required amount per sample (see sec-
tion 5.4) can be taken with a grater from different areas of the slab. However, since

the surfaces of slabs are usually oxidized, samples should be taken from a freshly
broken inner surface of the slab.

The required amount of cannabis oil (see section 5.4) can be taken as it is.
## 5.2  Minimum criteria for positive identification
## of cannabis
The following sections describe a number of methods for the examination and analy-
sis of cannabis products. The choice of the methodology and approach to analysis
as well as the decision whether or not additional methods are required remain with
the analyst and will also depend on the availability of appropriate instrumentation
and the level of legally acceptable proof in the jurisdiction within which the analyst
works. For cannabis products that exhibit characteristic botanical features, a com-
bination of colour test, thin-layer chromatography and physical (macroscopic and
microscopic) examination is considered an acceptable minimum analytical approach
for positive identification. General rules for method selection have been formulated
by the Scientific Working Group on Drugs (SWGDRUG) [40].
## 5.3  Physical examination
The methods used to identify cannabis products depend upon the nature of the
product. Herbal material can be identified based on its morphological characteristics
alone, provided that the required ones are present.
Where there are no morphological characteristics, as in the case of resin and hashish
oil, the identification is based on chemical analysis, demonstrating the presence of
cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its degradation product cannabi-
nol (CBN) and/or cannabidiol (CBD).
5.3.1  Macroscopic characteristics
Morphological characteristics and variation in colour of cannabis plants are influ-
enced by the seed strain as well as by environmental factors such as light, water,
nutrients and space.
As a dioecious herb, the flowers on individual plants are unisexual, however, there
are often transitional flowers and flowers of the opposite sex which develop later.
Male plants are usually taller but less robust than female plants. Stems are green,

erect, hollow and longitudinally grooved (figure 6). They can vary from 0.2-6 m,
although most of the plants reach heights of 1-3 m.
The extent of branching, like plant height, depends on environmental and hereditary
factors as well as the method of cultivation. The side branches vary from opposite
to alternate at any part of the main stem. The leaf arrangement changes from decus-
sate (oppositely arranged) to alternate on the extremities of the plant. Leaf stalks
(petioles) are 2-7 cm long with a narrow groove along the upper side. The leaf is
palmate and consists of 3-9 linear-lanceolate leaflet blades of 3-15 x 0.2-1.7 cm. The
margins are coarsely serrated, the teeth pointing towards the tips; the veins run out
obliquely from the midrib to the tips of the teeth. The lower (abaxial) surfaces are
pale green with scattered, white to yellowish brown, resinous glands (figure 7).

5.3.2  Microscopic characteristics
Cannabis sativa can be identified by microscopic structures on the surface of the
plant, namely, by trichomes (i.e. hair-like projections from a plant epidermal cell).
Two types of trichomes occur and can be observed with a binocular microscope
with a magnification factor of 40 as shown in figures 10 and 11:
(a) Non-glandular trichomes are numerous, unicellular, rigid and curved hairs, with
a slender pointed apex:
Cystolithic trichomes found on the upper surface of the cannabis leaves
"
"
have a characteristic bear claw shape and may have calcium carbonate
crystals (cystoliths) visible at their bases. Frequently, the trichome is broken
and the cystolith freed;
Non-cystolithic trichomes occur mainly on the lower side of the leaves,
"
"
bracts and bracteoles and lack the enlarged base;
The simultaneous presence of these bear claw-shaped trichomes on the
"
"
upper surface and the fine, slender non-cystolithic trichomes on the lower
surface of the leaves is a characteristic of cannabis.

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
The glandular trichomes are the structures where the cannabis resin is produced and
stored. These are mainly associated with the flower structures (pistillate plants being
particularly rich in these structures) but they can also be found on the underside of
the leaves and occasionally on the stems of young plants.
Some plants possess trichomes that may be confused with those present on Cannabis
sativa and care should be taken in definitive identification. However, the combination
of cystolithic hairs on the leaf upper surface and longer trichomes and sessile glands
on the lower surface, which is unique to Cannabis sativa , enables positive identifica-
tion of even fragmented material.
It should be noted, however, that very immature seedlings and stems with no
leaf attached cannot be definitively identified as Cannabis sativa by botanical
examination.
For details on cannabis identification and more sophisticated microscopy techniques,
the following literature can be consulted [43, 44, 45, 46].
## 5.4  Chemical examination
5.4.1  General aspects
THC is usually present at a quite low level in fresh plant material and is considered
to be derived artificially from THCA by non-enzymatic decarboxylation during
storage and consumption (e.g. smoking) [47].
In terms of analytical approach, it is a choice whether THCA and THC are measured
separately or whether “Total-THC” (i.e. the combined amount of THC and THCA)
is measured. This choice is sometimes made by national legislation. If there is no
legal requirement for either approach, it is common practice to measure Total-THC
since that best represents the pharmacological activity of the material.
Total-THC can be obtained by decarboxylation of THCA into THC. This can be
during or prior to analysis. For practical reasons the latter is recommended.
The sample extract can be put into a heating block at 150°C in an open glass vial.
After the evaporation of the solvent, decarboxylation is completed within five minutes.
However, it is recommended that this step be validated in each forensic laboratory.
Complete THCA decarboxylation may occur during injection in some gas chroma-
tography injector systems, whereas other injector systems show a very poor decarb-
oxylation at the same temperature. This is presumably due to different injector
geometries. A higher injection temperature may also cause THC decomposition in

33
the liner. Therefore, if decarboxylation is not performed prior to analysis, the specific
gas chromatograph system and analysis conditions must be validated to ensure that
they yield complete decarboxylation of THCA and do not cause decomposition of
THC [48].
5.4.2  Sample preparation for chemical examination
5.4.2.1  Preparation of herbal cannabis
Fresh (wet) plant material is either air dried at room temperature for several days
or dried at 70°C until the leaves become brittle. At this stage, the water content of
the plant material is typically 8-13 per cent.
The dried material is then coarsely selected (only flowers and leaves are used),
pulverized (preferably by a cutter with a high revolution speed, i.e. 100 rps) and
sieved (mesh size 1 mm).*
5.4.2.2  Preparation of cannabis resin
Cannabis resin is reduced to small pieces by a grater. Alternatively for sticky mate-
rial, the sample is cooled down with liquid nitrogen and immediately pulverized as
described above.
5.4.2.3  Preparation of cannabis oil
Cannabis oil can be used directly for analysis.
5.4.3  Presumptive tests
5.4.3.1  Colour tests
Colour tests for cannabis are among the most specific colour tests available (only a
few plants such as henna, nutmeg, mace and agrimony give false-positive results) [49].
However, a positive colour test only provides an indication of the possible presence
of cannabis-containing material and not a definitive identification of cannabis. It is
therefore mandatory for the analyst to confirm such results by the use of additional,
typically more discriminative techniques. For example, a laboratory may allow a
combination of a colour test, thin-layer chromatography and microscopy for cannabis
plant material for positive identification, provided that at least three cannabinoids are
identified by TLC [50].
-  Note that both drying and sieving are part of the validated methods described in this manual.
Sieving ensures homogeneity of the samples. Should the sieving process be skipped, the laboratory has
to demonstrate that the homogeneity is within the accepted tolerance.

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
The analyst is also strongly advised to co-analyse a cannabis control sample (e.g.
a reference material containing a mixture of cannabinoid reference standards) and
a blind sample to verify the test results and the functionality and reliability of all
test reagents.

Method
Fold two filter papers laid on top of each other into quarters and open them
partly to form a funnel, place a small amount of pulverized sample into the centre
of the upper paper. Add two drops of reagent A allowing the liquid to penetrate
to the lower filter paper. Discard the upper filter paper and allow the lower filter
paper to dry. Add a very small amount of reagent B to the centre of the filter
paper and then add two drops of reagent C.
Results
A purple red coloured stain at the centre of the filter paper is indicative of a
cannabis containing product. THC, CBN and CBD yield the same hue.
This is a practical advantage in a field test reagent for samples of different age
or origin.

This colour is a combination of the colours of the different cannabinoids which are
the major components of cannabis: THC = red, CBN = purple, CBD = orange.

5.4.3.2  Immunoassays
Immunoassays can be performed not only on biological samples, but also on minute
traces of the drug substance itself. However, as these analyses are costly and do not
add much power of proof, they are rarely used for presumptive identification.
5.4.4  Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)
THC screening can be performed by using an ion mobility spectrometer. Problems
with the separation from heroin signals and humidity have been noted [51]. It is
therefore not the method of choice.
5.4.5  Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
There are a number of TLC methods for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis
of cannabis, using a variety of different stationary phases (TLC plates) and solvent
systems, and slightly different sample preparation and spot visualization techniques.
Many of those methods also produce acceptable results but each method that is newly
introduced to a laboratory must be validated and/or verified prior to routine use. The
following method has been field-tested and is considered fit-for-purpose.
Plate: HPTLC 10 x 10 cm Silica gel
System A:
Petroleum ether 60/90
Diethyl ether
80% v/v
20% v/v
System B:

n-Hexane
Dioxane
Methanol
70% v/v
20% v/v
10% v/v
Tank conditioning:  30 min. with filter paper on one side.
Sample preparation
If the sole purpose of the THC examination is qualitative (i.e. to confirm the micro-
or macroscopic evidence that the suspect material is cannabis), homogenization of
the herbal material is not necessary (refer to section 5.4.2 for details of sample
preparation for chemical examination). Those parts of the cannabis plant known to
contain the highest levels of cannabinoids (i.e. the flowering tops and upper leaves)
should be selected for extraction.

*[Pagina 45]*

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
37
Suitable quantities for extraction are about 500 mg of herbal cannabis, 100 mg of
cannabis resin and 50 mg of liquid cannabis (cannabis oil). The extraction scheme
should be designed to produce final solutions with THC concentrations of about
0.5 mg/ml. Typical levels of THC in cannabis materials are listed in section 3.11.
The sample is extracted with 10 ml of solvent for 15 minutes at room temperature
by shaking or in an ultrasonic bath. The extract is filtered and is now ready for
chromatography.*
Since cannabinoids are easily soluble in most organic solvents, methanol, petroleum
ether, n-hexane, toluene, chloroform and solvent combinations, such as methanol :
chloroform (9:1) are equally suitable for their extraction. It should, however, be noted,
that non-polar solvents such as n-hexane and petroleum ether give a relatively clean
extract but will only extract the neutral/free cannabinoids quantitatively, while the
other solvents and their combinations give quantitative extractions of the cannabinoid
acids as well.
For identification, the simplest clean extraction with petroleum ether is enough,
while for the purposes of quantitation and total THC determinations other solvents
have to be used.
Standard solutions
The standard solutions should be prepared at a concentration of approximately 0.5 mg
cannabinoid per ml in methanol and should be stored in a cool, dark place.
Visualization
The plates must be dried prior to visualization. This can be done at room temperature
or by use of a drying box, oven or hot air. In the latter cases, care must be taken
that no component of interest is decomposed.
Spray reagent: (must be freshly prepared prior to use, preferably once per day)**
Method 1 :
Fast Blue B salt
50 mg in 20 ml of NaOH (0.1 N)
Method 2:
Fast Blue B salt
50 mg in 1 ml of water, then 20 ml of
methanol is added.
-  It should be noted that the procedure described is part of a method that has been field-tested and
was found fit-for purpose. Passive extraction, with the sample/solvent mixture allowed to stand, can also
be employed. Filtration can be done but is not required; use of the supernatant liquid should produce
reliable results. For identification purposes, smaller amounts of solvents and sample quantities may be
sufficient. Any modification to the method described needs to be evaluated in the analyst’s laboratory.
-  Daily preparation of the spray reagent may not be required when Fast Blue BB or Fast Blue RR
are used (0.2  per  cent w/v solution of Fast Blue BB or Fast Blue RR in methanol or methanol/water
1:1).

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
Note
It is important for proper colour development that the TLC plate be made alkaline.
One way of achieving this is by using visualization method 1. Alternatively,
diethylamine may be sprayed on the TLC plate before the Fast Blue B solution.
In all cases the plates should not be over wetted as spot diffusion may occur.
Fixation
To provide a permanent record, the analysis results need to be preserved. Preserva-
tion is best achieved by a succession of sprayings. Thus the spraying sequence is:
Diethylamine – Fast blue B solution – Diethylamine
The plates are then dried with hot air, or overnight at room temperature.
For storage, the plates are sealed inside clear plastic bags. Such plates have a
long lifetime without darkening. As an alternative, plates can be scanned or
photographed to provide a permanent record of the analysis results.
Note
Fast Blue B is claimed to be a potential carcinogen, so appropriate precautions
must be taken with it.
Results
Rf x 100 values are subject to variation depending on laboratory conditions (tem-
perature, humidity, etc.) as well as other parameters (e.g. age and quality of cannabis
materials used). It is therefore good practice to run cannabinoid standards along
with the sample on the same TLC plate.

5.4.6  Gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID),
without and with derivatization
Whether or not derivatization is required depends on the purpose of the analysis.
Without prior derivatization (i.e. silylation) of THC and THCA, GC analysis will
decarboxylate the latter and produce the total THC content of the cannabis sample,
which is the sum of free THC and THC generated from THCA. As the total THC
content represents the maximum potency of the usually smoked (and therefore also
decarboxylated) cannabis, most legal systems consider total THC content as the rele-
vant parameter. However, if both contents have to be reported, prior derivatization is
required (see also section 5.4.1).
5.4.6.1  Capillary column technique *
The method below is a validated method [52]. The validation encompasses the entire
process from sample preparation to GC analysis. Other methods may also produce
acceptable results but must be validated and/or verified prior to routine use.

Sample preparation
Two hundred mg of dry and homogenized herbal cannabis (see section 5.4.2) are
extracted with 20 ml internal standard (ISTD) solution (see below) for 15 minutes
in an ultrasonic bath. Due to the higher THC concentration in cannabis resin, only
100 mg resin is needed. If the sample is liquid cannabis (cannabis oil), a weight of
about 50 mg is sufficient.
As, depending on the GC system, it has not been established that the decarboxyla-
tion of THCA in the GC liner is quantitative, it is strongly recommended to carry
-  The packed column technique is no longer included in this manual as GC systems are now typi-
cally equipped with capillary columns (narrow-bore and mega-bore columns). Laboratories that are using
GC systems with packed columns are encouraged to continue to use their established (validated) methods.
Information about packed column techniques is available on request from lab@unodc.org.

out a decarboxylation step prior to the GC analysis.* To this end, 500 µl of the
solution is transferred to a 2 ml GC vial. The vial is put into a heating unit (150°C)
for 12 minutes where the solvent is evaporated and the THCA is decarboxylated.
The residue is dissolved in 1.5 ml ethanol, the vial is shaken well and the resulting
solution is then analyzed by GC.
Calibration
As THC reference material degrades rapidly and is not easily available in an accept-
able quality, the quantification of THC can be performed with CBN reference
material. The calibration with CBN instead of THC is known and widely accepted.
In theory the correlation factor is 1.00 [53]. For validation purposes, showing the
validity of the theoretical factor in the given gas chromatograph, it is good policy
to measure and monitor CBN ratio with a similar compound like CBD.
Solutions for calibration
CBN standard solutions are prepared in 2 ml GC vials according to the table

Silylation
If THCA has to be analysed separately, i.e. without decarboxylation, 1.5 ml aliquots
of the above (non-thermally decarboxylated) extract has to be derivatized before GC
analysis. Derivatizing agents frequently used are:
MSTFA:
N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide
BSTFA/TMCS:
N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide/Trimethylchloro-
silane (1 per cent)
Silylizable solvents such as ethanol have to be removed, usually by a gentle stream
of nitrogen. The residue is taken up in 1.5 ml chloroform. 100 µl MSTFA are added
and heated for 30 min at 70°C. The resulting solution can be analysed directly.
5.4.7  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
The GC-MS analysis can be performed analogous to the GC-FID analysis.
Reference spectra of the most common cannabinoids, in derivatized or underivatized
form, are available in common commercial MS databases.

(THC + THCOOH) in herbal cannabis after extraction with methanol/chloroform and
subsequent decarboxylation [54, 55]. The validation encompasses the entire ­process

able results but must be validated and/or verified prior to routine use. With adequate
verification, the same method can also be applied to other cannabis products.

Sample preparation
500 mg of dry and homogenized herbal cannabis (see section 5.4.2) are extracted with
5 ml methanol : chloroform (9:1 v/v) by the following procedure: 10 seconds on a
vortex, 15 min. ultrasonic bath including again vortexing after 5, 10 and 15 minutes,
then centrifugation.
Decarboxylation
200 µl of the above extract are transferred into a derivatization vessel. The solvent is
evaporated under nitrogen gas to dryness. The sample is decarboxylated for 15 minutes
at 210°C. The residue is dissolved in 200 µl methanol : chloroform (9:1 v/v).
Preparation of the final solution
The above decarboxylation solution is diluted with methanol by a factor of 100 (in
two steps, each 100 µl + 900 µl) and is then used for the analysis.
For lower THC contents (< 0.5 per cent), a dilution factor of 10 instead of 100 is
sufficient.

# 6.  Additional analytical techniques and
# approaches for the analysis of
# cannabis products
This section gives a brief overview of some additional techniques and approaches
that can be applied to the analysis of cannabis products.
## 6.1  GC-FID profiling of seizures of cannabis
## products
For a chemometric classification, standardized GC profiles are used. The analysis
can be performed on a standard column. For cluster analysis, the terpenoid range,
which mainly consists of sesquiterpenes, is used. GC profiles of cannabis specimens
with the same origin show a similar peak pattern, thus allowing samples to be linked.
Correlation studies indicate that it might be feasible to determine the geographic
origin of a cannabis specimen on the basis of its chemical signature [56].
However, because of the high natural variability of cannabis, the need for authentic
cannabis reference material (i.e. of known origin), and the use of likelihood ratios
(probabilities) to describe regions of origin, the forensic value of GC profiles for
the purposes of origin determinations may be limited.
By contrast, this approach could be used for batch-to-batch analysis. This could
provide the opportunity to link samples of the same age, phenotype and production
facility. The feasibility would have to be proven using a large data set.
## 6.2  Solid phase-micro extraction (SPME)
SPME is a solvent-free sample preparation technique, which can be used for the
sampling and analysis of volatile chemical markers in the headspace over solutions,
directly over the suspected material, or it can be used for the analysis of aqueous
solutions containing the target analytes. For cannabis products the SPME analysis
of both volatile constituents and the cannabinoids have been reported [57, 58].

Recommended methods for the identification and analysis of cannabis and cannabis products
Headspace-SPME of has also been performed in hemp food using alkaline hydrolysis
(NaOH) and on-fibre derivatization (MSTFA) followed by gas chromatographic-
mass spectrometric (GC-MS) detection. Using deuterated standards, the method
proved to be robust for the analysis of the main cannabinoids THC, CBN and CBD
and, compared to liquid-liquid extraction, it is substantially faster [59].
## 6.3  Stable isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (IRMS)
The variation of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen is most useful for
sourcing the geographical origin of plant materials. Unlike other drugs such as heroin
and cocaine, cannabis is not chemically processed for illicit supply and therefore
maintains its original elemental and isotopic profiles. Thus, these parameters could be
used as an indication of geographical origin [60].
However, different growing conditions (e.g. amount of watering, grown without or
with soil, i.e. indoor or outdoor grown, type of soil and fertilizer, etc.) can affect
the isotopic composition of the plants and thus discrimination may be limited [61].
In addition, meaningful results are only possible when authentic cannabis reference
material (of known origin) is available.
## 6.4  DNA profiling
This technique provides the opportunity to link products on the basis of their genetic
profiles, which could be useful from an investigative point of view, e.g. to link
producers, traffickers and consumers.
However, unlike human DNA, such a fingerprint may not necessarily be unique,
as cloning of cannabis strains is quite common. Matching DNA profiles of two
samples does therefore not by itself prove that they come from the same plant, let
alone the same grower. Due to the fact that growers also sell their cuttings, the
forensic value of a match obtained with this relatively expensive technique is some-
times questionable.
For an overview and description of the different DNA testing methods, see
reference 62.
