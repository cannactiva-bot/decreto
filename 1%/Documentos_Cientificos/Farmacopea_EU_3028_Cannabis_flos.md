PRODUCTION
If the herbal drug is to be prescribed to patients as a medicinal
product, the inﬂorescence is cut at the base with minimal
rachis remaining.
IDENTIFICATION
A. Depending on the variety, the colour of the herbal drug
varies from dark green to pale yellow or from light brown
to reddish-brown. The whole female inﬂorescence is a
dense or more or less lax panicle, comprising sessile or
almost sessile, elongated bracts (about 10 mm long) with
dentate margins, intermingled with the ﬂowers. The
fragmented inﬂorescence, comprises parts of the axis of
the inﬂorescence, the bracts and panicle, together with
individual ﬂowers or ﬂoral organs. The female ﬂowers are
very small (about 2 mm) with a short pedicel. The perianth
is monosepalous and apetalous. The sepal, often referred
to as the bracteole, is wrapped around the unilocular
ovary which bears two styles, each terminating in a ﬁne,
orange-brown stigma that is longer than the calyx. The
inﬂorescence is more or less densely pilose, with covering
trichomes and glandular trichomes that produce a sticky
resin with an aromatic odour.
B. Microscopic examination ( 2.8.23 ), on the milled or
ground herbal drug (not sieved). The colour varies from
dark green to yellowish-green or from light brown to
reddish-brown. Examine under a microscope using chloral
hydrate solution R . The milled or ground herbal drug
shows the following diagnostic characters (Figure 3028.-1):
very numerous glandular or covering trichomes, free or
attached to epidermis, of different types: a) whole glandular
trichomes, with a multiseriate, multicellular stalk and a
multicellular head covered by a domed cuticle (transverse
section [E]), or fragments of these trichomes comprising
the stalk or head [A] only; some have a very short stalk
[Ha], others are sessile; some still have the domed cuticle
over the glandular cells (surface view [Da], transverse
section [Ea]) while others no longer have it [A]; b) small
glandular trichomes with a uni- or biseriate stalk and a
uni-, bi- or quadricellular head containing orange-yellow
droplets (surface view [Bc, Ca, J], side view [Cb, La, Lb]); c)
cystolithic [Fa, Ka] and non-cystolithic unicellular covering
trichomes; the conical, cystolithic covering trichomes
have either thickened walls, a broad base and a curved,
pointed end, with a clearly visible, lumpy, globular calcium
carbonate deposit (surface view [Ba], transverse section
[Ka]), or a narrower base and markedly pitted walls [Fa];
the non-cystolithic covering trichomes are more elongated
and have thickened, smooth walls [Hb]; fragments of
the upper epidermis of the bracts (surface view [B, F, L])
sometimes covered by a ﬁne, striated cuticle composed of
polygonal cells with rigid walls [Bb], cystolithic covering
trichomes [Ba, Fa] and small glandular trichomes (surface
view [Bc], side view [La, Lb]); the upper epidermis is
usually associated with palisade parenchyma with some
cells containing small cluster crystals of calcium oxalate
[Bd]; fragments of the lower epidermis of the bracts
[D] comprising cells with slightly sinuous walls [Db],
anomocytic stomata ( 2.8.3 ) [Dc], small glandular trichomes
[Dd] and glandular trichomes with a multicellular stalk
and a multicellular head [Da]; fragments of the lamina of
the bracts (transverse section [K]) comprising the upper
epidermis covered by a cuticle [Kb], with rectangular
cells and cystolithic covering trichomes [Ka], and the
palisade parenchyma layer with some cells containing a
small cluster crystal of calcium oxalate [Kc]; fragments
of the lower epidermis of the bracteoles [H] with slightly
wavy cells [Hc], glandular trichomes with a short stalk
[Ha], anomocytic stomata [Hd], non-cystolithic covering
trichomes [Hb] and small glandular trichomes [He]; small
cluster crystals of the underlying mesophyll are clearly
visible in the fragments of the bracteole epidermises [Hf ];
fragments of the orange-brown stigmas showing epidermal
cells with very ﬁne, faintly visible walls, terminating in
large papillae with a rounded end [G]; fragments of the
axis of the inﬂorescence [N] comprising cellulose ﬁbres,
spiral [Na] or annular vessels, and cells of the pith with

reticulate walls [Nb], some of which contain cluster crystals
of calcium oxalate of about 30 μm in diameter; free cluster
crystals of calcium oxalate [M].

System suitability : reference solution (c):
- the chromatogram shows in the middle third 2 distinct
zones, which may be touching; the lower zone
(cannabidiolic acid) and the upper zone (cannabidiol)
are grey to reddish-violet.
Results : see below the sequence of zones present in the
chromatograms obtained with reference solution (a) and the
test solution. Furthermore, in the chromatogram obtained
with the test solution, other very faint zones may be present.
If present, the zone due to Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinolic acid is
more intense than the zone due to Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol.
If present, the zone due to cannabidiolic acid is more
intense than the zone due to cannabidiol.
