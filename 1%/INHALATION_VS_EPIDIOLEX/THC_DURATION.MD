# THC Effect Duration: Oral Administration Lasts 2-3 Times Longer Than Inhalation

**Oral THC produces substantially longer psychoactive effects than inhaled THC, lasting 4-12 hours versus 2-4 hours**—a factor of approximately 2-3 times longer. More critically, oral administration generates dramatically higher levels of the potent metabolite 11-OH-THC through first-pass liver metabolism, with **AUC exposures up to 768 times greater** than inhalation. These pharmacological differences fundamentally alter the total psychoactive impact of oral versus inhaled cannabis products.

This comprehensive review synthesizes findings from controlled human studies, systematic reviews, and FDA pharmaceutical data spanning 2003-2024. The evidence consistently demonstrates that route of administration—not just THC dose—determines both the intensity profile and total duration of cannabis effects.

## Pharmacodynamic parameters show consistent oral-inhaled differences

The most rigorous evidence comes from within-subjects crossover studies where the same individuals received both oral and inhaled THC under controlled conditions. **Spindle et al. (2021)** conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 20 infrequent cannabis users comparing cannabis brownies (10, 25 mg THC) to vaporized cannabis (5, 20 mg THC). Peak subjective effects occurred at **2-5 hours post-dose for oral** versus **0-2 hours for inhaled**, with oral effects persisting up to 8 hours total.

**Vandrey et al. (2017)** demonstrated in a residential study that oral cannabis brownies (10-50 mg THC) produced effects with onset at 30-60 minutes, sustained peak effects at **90-180 minutes**, and gradual decline over **6-8 hours**. Critically, two participants showed significant impairment despite undetectable blood THC concentrations—illustrating the poor correlation between blood levels and functional effects with oral administration.

| Parameter | Oral THC | Inhaled THC | Factor Difference |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Effect onset** | 30-90 minutes | Seconds to minutes | Oral ~10-30× slower |
| **Time to peak (Tmax)** | 2-4 hours | 15-30 minutes | Oral 4-8× later |
| **Duration to baseline** | 4-12 hours | 2-4 hours | Oral **2-3× longer** |
| **Blood THC Cmax** | 1-11 ng/mL | 15-192 ng/mL | Inhaled 10-20× higher |

The seminal reviews by **Huestis (2007)** and **Grotenhermen (2003)** established these parameters across multiple studies, confirming oral effect duration of **4-12 hours** versus inhaled duration of **2-3 hours**—consistent with a **3-6× factor** at the upper range.

## Driving impairment data confirms extended oral effect windows

The **McCartney et al. (2021)** meta-analysis examined 80 studies over 20 years, encompassing 481 effect estimates for inhaled and 243 for oral THC. This authoritative analysis found:

- **Inhaled cannabis impairment**: Most driving-related cognitive skills recover within **~5 hours** of inhaling 20 mg THC; nearly all skills recover within **7 hours**
- **Oral cannabis impairment**: May persist **up to 10 hours** at high doses, with peak impairment occurring **2-5 hours** post-ingestion

The impairment duration ratio (oral/inhaled) was approximately **1.5-2.5× longer for oral administration**, more pronounced at lower and moderate doses. **Schlienz et al. (2020)** confirmed that oral cannabis (25-50 mg THC brownies) produced cognitive impairment still measurable at the 8-hour study endpoint, with high-dose effects likely extending beyond this window.

Current regulatory guidelines reflect this evidence. Colorado recommends waiting **≥6 hours after inhaled cannabis** (≤35 mg THC) but **≥8 hours after edibles** (≤18 mg THC) before driving. The Canadian Centre on Substance Use recommends **6-8 hours for inhaled** versus **8-12 hours for oral** administration.

## 11-OH-THC metabolite production explains oral potency amplification

The most striking pharmacological difference between routes involves the active metabolite **11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC)**. When THC is swallowed, first-pass hepatic metabolism via CYP2C9 enzymes converts substantial THC to 11-OH-THC before systemic distribution—a process largely bypassed with inhalation.

**Quantitative differences are dramatic:**

| Parameter | Oral Administration | Inhaled Administration | Ratio |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **11-OH-THC:THC ratio** | 0.5:1 to 3:1 (50-300%) | <1:20 (~5%) | Oral **10-60× higher** |
| **11-OH-THC AUC** | 14,600 μg/L (28 μM) | 19 μg/L (0.06 μM) | Oral **~768× higher** |

Data from **Nadulski et al. (2005)** demonstrated that for equivalent 10 mg THC doses, oral administration produced approximately **768 times greater 11-OH-THC exposure** (AUC) than smoking. This metabolite is pharmacologically significant: classic human studies by **Lemberger et al. (1972)** and **Perez-Reyes et al. (1972)** demonstrated that 1 mg intravenous 11-OH-THC produced faster onset (peak 3-5 minutes versus 10-20 minutes for THC) and **more intense subjective effects** than equivalent THC.

The receptor binding data supports enhanced potency: 11-OH-THC exhibits CB1 receptor affinity of **Ki = 0.37 nM** versus **Ki = 35 nM** for THC—approximately 95-fold higher binding affinity. Functional potency estimates range from **2-4× more potent** in human subjective studies to **153% as active** in animal nociception models.

**Calapai et al. (2020)** demonstrated that 11-OH-THC crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than THC, with brain extraction of **67-70%** from plasma versus only **~50%** for THC. This enhanced CNS penetration amplifies the psychoactive contribution of the metabolite formed during oral administration.

## Dronabinol pharmaceutical data provides controlled oral THC benchmarks

Dronabinol (Marinol®), synthetic oral THC in sesame oil capsules, offers the cleanest pharmacodynamic data for oral administration without the variability of plant-based cannabis. **FDA prescribing information** documents:

- **Peak psychoactive effect**: 2-4 hours after administration
- **Duration of psychoactive effects**: 4-6 hours (appetite stimulant effects may persist **24 hours or longer**)
- **Tmax**: 0.5-4 hours (median ~2.5 hours fasted)
- **Bioavailability**: 10-20% (extensive first-pass metabolism)

The **Cooper et al. (2013)** head-to-head study directly compared dronabinol (10, 20 mg) to smoked marijuana (1.98-3.56% THC) in 30 daily cannabis users. **Peak analgesic effects occurred at 15 minutes for smoked marijuana versus 180 minutes (3 hours) for dronabinol**, and dronabinol's effects lasted substantially longer. The study authors concluded that "dronabinol administration decreased pain sensitivity and increased pain tolerance that peaked later and lasted longer relative to smoked marijuana."

| Endpoint | Dronabinol | Smoked Marijuana |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Peak subjective effects | 60 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Peak analgesic effects | 180 minutes (3 hours) | 15 minutes |
| Duration | Longer-lasting | Shorter |

## Methodological quality varies across the evidence base

The strongest evidence comes from **within-subjects crossover designs** that control for individual variability in metabolism and sensitivity. Key high-quality studies include:

**Spindle et al. (2021)** – PMID: 34049452 – Double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover in infrequent users with standardized dosing and comprehensive outcome measures (DEQ, DSST, DAT, PASAT, DRUID®). **Quality: Excellent.**

**Vandrey et al. (2017)** – PMID: 28158482 – Residential study with controlled dosing, standardized meals, and 9-day blood sampling. **Quality: Excellent.**

**Newmeyer et al. (2017)** – PMID: 28407543 – Within-subjects comparison of oral, smoked, and vaporized routes in frequent and occasional users. **Quality: Excellent.**

**McCartney et al. (2021)** – Meta-analysis of 80 studies with sophisticated statistical modeling. **Quality: Excellent** for synthesis, though limited by heterogeneity in original study designs.

**Grotenhermen (2003)** – PMID: 12648025 – and **Huestis (2007)** – PMID: 17712819 – remain authoritative comprehensive reviews despite age, as foundational pharmacological principles remain unchanged.

Limitations across the literature include: predominance of infrequent cannabis users in recent studies (may not generalize to tolerant users), relatively short follow-up periods (8 hours maximum in most studies, potentially missing oral effect offset), and variable dosing approaches making direct comparisons challenging.

## Regulatory implications for oral versus inhaled cannabis products

The pharmacological evidence supports several conclusions relevant to comparative regulation:

**Effect duration factor**: Oral THC produces effects lasting **2-3× longer** than equivalent inhaled doses under typical conditions, extending to **3-6× longer** in some studies. This prolonged exposure window means that even lower THC doses administered orally may produce greater total psychoactive burden over time.

**Metabolite amplification**: The **768× greater 11-OH-THC AUC** with oral administration, combined with the metabolite's **2-4× greater potency** and enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration, substantially amplifies total psychoactive impact beyond what nominal THC content alone would predict.

**Impairment window**: Functional impairment from oral cannabis extends to **8-12 hours** versus **5-7 hours** for inhaled routes, creating a longer period of compromised capacity.

**Correction regarding Epidiolex**: FDA prescribing information and clinical pharmacology data confirm that Epidiolex contains **no detectable THC**—it is 99% pure CBD with THC synthetically extracted. Human abuse potential studies demonstrated that Epidiolex at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses (up to 4,500 mg) produced drug-liking scores within the placebo range, while dronabinol 10-30 mg produced significant increases in positive subjective measures. Epidiolex was descheduled by the DEA in April 2020 and is no longer subject to controlled substance regulations. This finding does not support a regulatory argument based on trace THC content in Epidiolex.

## Conclusion

The scientific evidence unequivocally demonstrates that oral THC administration produces psychoactive effects lasting **2-3× longer** than inhaled THC (4-12 hours versus 2-4 hours), with onset delayed by approximately **30-90 minutes versus immediate** and peak effects occurring at **2-4 hours versus 15-30 minutes**. The critical amplifying factor is first-pass hepatic metabolism generating 11-OH-THC: oral administration produces up to **768× greater metabolite exposure**, and this metabolite exhibits **2-4× higher potency** with enhanced CNS penetration.

These pharmacological realities mean that THC dose alone inadequately characterizes psychoactive exposure—route of administration fundamentally modifies the effect profile. For regulatory and clinical purposes, **1 mg oral THC does not equal 1 mg inhaled THC** in terms of total psychoactive impact. However, the hypothesized comparison to Epidiolex is not supported, as this pharmaceutical product contains no THC and produces no cannabimimetic subjective effects at any tested dose.
