# POSITION PAPER

## Hemp sector proposal for CAP 2028-2034:
### Alignment with international THC standards.

Cannabis Hub - January 2026 **Cannabis Hub - January 2026**.

---

## Executive Summary

The European Commission has proposed the new CAP 2028-2034 (COM(2025) 560) and the revision of the CMO (COM(2025) 553), where **significant improvements** appear for the industrial hemp sector. Furthermore, the European Parliament has also spoken out to strengthen the regulatory framework for hemp and to help this crop given its **environmental, economic and social advantages**.

The European and Spanish hemp sector **welcomes** this willingness to improve, as well as the European Parliament's recognition of the need to overcome regulatory criteria that have become obsolete. In order to effectively align with international standards -as the Parliament itself has expressed-, we request the establishment of a **new harmonized THC threshold** at the Union level.

Cannabis Hub proposes this threshold for industrial hemp in line with the decision of the Agriculture Commission of the Congress of Deputies (PNL 161/004332, January 2023), which established the need to align Spain with international standards, setting the safe limit at **1% THC**.

These measures are **legally sound**, **scientifically justified**, **proportionate** and **complementary**.

A harmonized threshold aligned with international standards would **strengthen the internal market**, **guarantee legal certainty** for farmers and breeders, **restore competitiveness** vis-Ã -vis global producers and **reflect agronomic and climatic realities**, without risk of abuse or harm to public health.

# 1. INSTITUTIONAL MOMENTUM

The debate on the THC threshold for industrial hemp is situated in the framework of the **PAC and the CMO**, not in the field of narcotic drugs. The 1961 Single Convention expressly states (Art. 28.2) that its provisions **"shall not apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant intended exclusively for industrial (fiber and seeds) or horticultural purposes "**. The THC threshold is therefore a matter of agricultural policy and the internal market.

## 1.1 Mandate of the Congress of Deputies: Spain has already asked for 1%.

On January 25, 2023, the Congress of Deputies processed **ProposiciÃ³n No de Ley 161/004332** in the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Point 3 of the NLP states:

> *"To establish in a future regulation of non-psychoactive cannabis the limitation of the percentage of THC to **1%**, thus ensuring the absence of narcotic effects, as well as a higher yield of crops and their sustainability according to the **European Green Pact**; something that, if not done, would force to operate in this market with a **clear disadvantage** with respect to other countries of our environment. "*

The PNL was presented by the Confederal Parliamentary Groups Unidas Podemos-En ComÃº Podem-Galicia en ComÃºn, Euskal Herria Bildu and Republican. This Spanish parliamentary mandate **anticipates by more than two years** the position of the European Parliament and constitutes the legitimizing basis of the present request.

## 1.2 Position of the European Parliament (September 2025)

The EP Resolution on agriculture and CAP post-2027 (P10_TA(2025)0189, point 129) marks a European institutional milestone, although it **falls short** of the Spanish mandate:

> * *"Stresses the importance of explicitly confirming the legality of the cultivation, harvesting, processing and marketing of all parts of the hemp plant [....]; notes that hemp cultivation requires relatively few inputs, especially fertilizers, plant protection products and water; stresses that it also contributes to soil health and biodiversity [...]; calls on the Commission to establish a common Union-wide threshold of **0.5% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)**".

The EP recognizes the need to raise the threshold, but its proposal of 0.5% does not reach the level of ambition of the Spanish mandate (1%).

## 1.3 Sectoral position: EIHA

The European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) [28] supports the 0.5%, arguing that it would strengthen the internal market, ensure legal certainty and restore competitiveness vis-Ã -vis global producers, **"without risk of abuse or harm to public health "**. Cannabis Hub shares these arguments, but argues that they logically lead to 1%, not 0.5%.

## 1.4 Current regulatory context

The proposals COM(2025) 553 (CMO) and COM(2025) 560 (CAP) maintain the 0.3%, but introduce for the first time CN code 1211 90 86 ("other parts of the plant"), including **flowers and biomass** in the regulatory framework. This broadening of scope reinforces the need for a robust threshold to support the value chain of extracts and derivatives.

# 2. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED THRESHOLD

## 2.0 FRAMEWORK: A CONVERGENCE OF ARGUMENTS

The proposal to raise the threshold to 1% THC does not respond to a single sectoral motivation. It is the result of a **convergence of arguments** that, when analyzed together, make 1% the most coherent and well-founded option:

- **Historical**: The 0.3% threshold lacks a solid scientific basis and its author himself considers it obsolete.

- **Scientific and environmental**: higher yielding varieties - currently excluded by the restrictive threshold - could be incorporated into the European catalog, improving the sector's productivity and COâ capture.

- **Political and economic**: 18 jurisdictions already operate with this standard. Aligning facilitates the free movement of goods and removes competitive barriers for the European sector.

- **Social**: 1% THC presents no realistic risk of abuse or harm to public health.

The evidence supporting each of these pillars of argument is developed below.

## 2.1 HISTORICAL ARGUMENT: 0.3% REBUTTAL

The 0.3% THC threshold for industrial hemp in the European Union was established in **1984**. However, **there is no documentation to justify the choice of this figure** or the technical or scientific criteria that supported it.

The only contemporary scientific reference that establishes 0.3% as the cut-off point is the taxonomic classification of **Dr. Ernest Small** [1], which suggests it was the source adopted by the European legislator. The analysis of his original work is determinative.

Small & Cronquist used plants grown in Ottawa from Lithuanian seeds to differentiate hemp from marijuana. In their study they stated:

> *"It will be noted that we **arbitrarily adopt** a concentration of 0.3% Î9-THC (dry weight basis) in **young, vigorous leaves** of relatively mature plants as a **guide to discriminating two classes of plants**. "*
> *--- Taxon 25(4): 408*

Two relevant elements emerge from this foundational quote. First, the authors themselves acknowledge that the criterion was adopted **arbitrarily**, without toxicological substantiation. Second, the threshold was measured in **young leaves** of Lithuanian hemp grown in Canadian greenhouses---not in flowers, where concentrations are higher, nor in European field conditions.

Dr. Small himself confirmed in 2021 [2] that the criterion was established *"on strictly taxonomic considerations"* and currently constitutes *"a hindrance to the industry"*. His conclusion is unequivocal: the real potential for abuse *"requires a concentration of approximately 1% THC"*, therefore **"1% THC would be a more suitable criterion"**.

After five decades of genetic advances and climate change, the scientific evidence supports this revision.

## 2.2 SCIENTIFIC-ENVIRONMENTAL ARGUMENT: YIELD AND CLIMATE

### Scientific basis: why low threshold punishes performance

Scientific evidence documents a **functional correlation** between cannabinoid content and biomass yield in *Cannabis sativa* L. This association is not casual, but responds to well-documented biological mechanisms:

**1. Selection for compliance = loss of productivity.** Hemp varieties developed to meet ultra-low THC thresholds have sacrificed yield. The Hungarian breeding program (1994-2019) documented that varieties selected for chemical stability yield **10-20% less** than traditional varieties of higher genetic diversity [7,8].

**2. Shared metabolic pathways.** Cannabinoid and terpenoid biosynthesis share common precursors. Plants with higher photosynthetic capacity channel surpluses into secondary metabolism, simultaneously producing **more biomass and more cannabinoids** [9].

**3. Extended phenological cycle.** Late flowering varieties maximize the vegetative period and biomass accumulation, but also express higher pre-harvest THC synthesis [10]. Restricting THC means restricting these high-yielding varieties.

**Direct policy implication: The regulatory threshold operates as a **negative selection** that systematically excludes the most productive germplasm from the European market.

### Quantifying the opportunity cost: European evidence

Controlled field trials under European conditions reveal statistically significant yield differences according to cannabinoid profile. Rahemi et al [6] documented in multi-year trials the following results:

| Variety | Reproductive system | Historic THC | Dry stem biomass (t/ha) | Differential |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Carmagnola** | Dioica italiana | 0,4-0,6% | **8,62** | **+87,4%** |
| Futura 75 | French Monoica | <0.2% | 4.60 | *baseline* |
| Fedora 17 | French Monoica | | <0.2% | 4.35 | -5.4% |

**Carmagnola**, the traditional dioica variety from Piedmont with historical THC content 0.4-0.6%, produces **8.62 tons per hectare** - almost twice as much as the conforming French monoicas. However, this variety is **functionally excluded from the European market** for exceeding the 0.3% threshold.
The Hungarian breeding program led by BÃ³csa (1994-2019) further quantified the systematic cost of the monoecious system: **"All monoecious cultivars yielded 10 to 20% less than dioecious cultivars due to inbreeding depression from self-pollination. "** This 10-20% differential represents the **agronomic price** of chemical stability required by restrictive thresholds.

The implication is straightforward: Europe systematically sacrifices between **2-4 tons of biomass per hectare** for purely regulatory reasons.

### The international competitive gap: benchmarking with Chinese germplasm

North Carolina State University trials with Chinese accessions reveal the magnitude of the **competitive cost** of the European threshold. Halker et al [5] evaluated fiber varieties under controlled conditions:

| Accession | Documented THC (%) | Dry stem yield (t/ha) | Ratio vs. current EU |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Yuma** | **0.723** | **35.1** | **Ã7.6** | **Ã7.6** |
| **Bama** | **0.506** | **22.3** | **Ã4.8** | **Ã4.8** |
| *Baseline UE* | <0.3 | ~4.6 | - | |

The results are consistent and reproducible: **Yuma** (0.723% THC) and **Bama** (0.506% THC) varieties achieve yields of **35.1 and 22.3 t/ha** respectively - between **4.8 and 7.6 times higher** than current European varieties.

**The pattern is unambiguous**: Halker et al. [5], in their study *"Evaluating Chinese fiber hemp varieties and planting dates in North Carolina "*, concluded that high-yielding Chinese varieties, with THC levels between **0.4% and 0.9%**, are **inviable for the European market** under the current threshold of 0.3%. This means that Europe is deliberately giving up the world's most productive germplasm for a regulatory restriction with no sound scientific basis.

While Europe optimizes for chemical compliance, China develops varieties capable of producing **more than 35 tons of biomass per hectare**. The strategic divergence could not be clearer: **selection for productivity versus selection for regulatory compliance**.

### Implications for Europe's climate goals

The European Parliament explicitly recognizes that hemp **"contributes to soil health and biodiversity "** and constitutes a crop with low environmental impact. However, THC restrictions drastically limit the sector's carbon sequestration potential.

Using the standard stoichiometric conversion (1 kg dry biomass = 1.62 kg COâ absorbed) and the current European hemp area (~40,000 ha), calculations reveal the climate cost of the restrictive threshold:

| Regulatory scenario | THC maximum | Annual total biomass | Annual COâ sequestered | Differential |
|----------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Status quo UE** | 0.2-0.3% | 200,000 t | 324,000 t | *baseline | |
| | **Carmagnola (historical)** | 0.5% | 344,800 t | 558,576 t | **+72%** | |
Asian Germoplasma** | 0.7-1.0% | 1,000,000 t | 1,620,000 t | 1,620,000 t** | **+400%** | 1,000,000 t | 1,000,000 t | 1,620,000 t **+400%** | 1,000,000 t
**Climate opportunity cost: 1,296,000 tons of COâ per year not captured.

To contextualize this magnitude in terms of European climate policies:

- **Equivalent to the annual emissions** of 324,000 average European cars.
- Represents the absorption capacity of 400,000 hectares of Amazonian rainforest** - an area larger than Luxembourg
- Exceeds the annual COâ emissions of the European Parliament by 13 times** (100,000 t)
- **Constitutes 0.04%** of the EU's 2030 net emissions reduction target.

**The regulatory paradox is evident**: while the EU invests billions in carbon capture technologies, it simultaneously restricts access to plant germplasm that could quintuple the sequestration efficiency of the hemp sector **at no additional cost of agricultural land**.

### Conclusion: policy coherence and scientific evidence

The empirical evidence presented reveals a **fundamental inconsistency** in the European regulatory framework. The European Parliament officially recognizes that industrial hemp contributes to climate, biodiversity and agricultural sustainability objectives. Simultaneously, restrictions on THC content systematically exclude germplasm that would maximize these contributions.

The data are unequivocal:

- **Carmagnola** (+87% yield) remains excluded by 0.1-0.3 percentage points of THC.
- Elite Asian varieties** (Ã4-7 higher yield) are inaccessible under the current threshold.
- **1,296,000 tons/year of COâ** are not captured due to regulatory, not agronomic, restrictions.

The scientific evidence presented leads to an unequivocal conclusion: **the hemp varieties with the highest agronomic and environmental potential are consistently above 0.5% THC**. The elite genetics - both traditional European and Asian - express THC profiles in the 0.4-0.9% range, incompatible with any threshold below 1.0%.

This scientific observation coincides with the assessment of Dr. Ernest Small, original author of the 0.3% criterion, who in 2021 concluded that *"1% THC would be a more suitable criterion "* for industrial hemp, recognizing that the potential for practical abuse requires significantly higher concentrations.

The central question transcends analytical chemistry: **should European agricultural policy optimize for compliance with arbitrary thresholds or for maximization of agronomic, environmental and climatic benefits?** ** The central question is: **should European agricultural policy optimize for compliance with arbitrary thresholds or for maximization of agronomic, environmental and climatic benefits?

The data suggest that the opportunity cost of the status quo - measured in lost competitiveness, unrealized carbon sequestration and wasted agronomic potential - far exceeds any regulatory benefits of maintaining ultra-conservative restrictions on a safe and legal industrial feedstock.

**This scientific evidence is already influencing international policy**: a growing number of jurisdictions have adopted the 1% THC threshold, recognizing the agronomic realities that this section has documented.

## 2.3 POLITICAL-ECONOMIC ARGUMENT: EUROPE MUST ALIGN WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TREND

The global analysis updated to January 2026 confirms that **1% THC** is not a radical proposal, but a **consolidated international standard**. The European Union must take this reality into account in order to maintain its competitiveness in the global industrial hemp market.

The most advanced case is **South Africa**, which in December 2025 raised its threshold to **2.0% THC**, justifying it by climatic conditions that naturally increase THC content and the need to avoid crop losses ("hot crops"). This precedent shows that even thresholds above 1% are feasible without compromising public safety.

However, the prevailing international standard is 1% THC, adopted by more than 20 jurisdictions on all continents:

### European Zone and Economic Area

| Country | THC limit | Legal framework | Validity | Comments |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Switzerland **Switzerland** | 1.0% | Narcotic Drugs Act (LStup) | 2011 | European pioneer. Commercialized in EU market >10 years without incident. |
| Luxembourg** | â¤1.0% | Tobacco Control Act | 2023 | EU Member State. Tobacco substitute products. |
| Czech Republic** | 1.0% | Psychomodulatory Substances Act | Jan 2025 | Bilateral import agreements with Uruguay. |

While not a limit for hemp, the official monograph defines that **below 1% is not considered medicinal**. |

### Mercosur Zone and Latin America

The Latin American bloc has largely adopted the **1% THC**, with direct implications for European trade policy:

| Country | THC limit | Legal framework | Validity | Comments |

| **Uruguay** | 1.0% | Law 19.172 + Decree 372/2014 | Dec 2013 | Regional pioneer. [Active export protocols](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-ganaderia-agricultura-pesca/sites/ministerio-ganaderia-agricultura-pesca/files/2022-12/Procedimiento%20para%20exportar%20flores%20o%20biomasa%20de%20c%C3%A1%C3%B1amo%20a%20EEUU%20Diciembre%202022.pdf) (MGAP, 2022). |
**Argentina** | 1.0% | Law 27,669 + Decree 405/2023 | 2022-2023 | Integral framework for industrial hemp. |

| Ecuador** | 1.0% | Ministerial Agreement 109-2020 | 2020 | Non-psychoactive Cannabis. |
| Peru** 1.0% | Law 32195 | Dec 2024 | Industrial hemp. |
| Mexico** | 1.0% | General Health Law Art. 245 | 2017 | Industrial products. |
| Costa Rica** | 1.0% | Law 10113 + RTCR 515:2024 | 2022 | Complete technical framework. |
| Panama** | 1.0% | Law 464 | Mar 2025 | Industrial hemp. |
| Jamaica** â¤1.0% | Dangerous Drugs Amendment Act | Apr 2015 | Hemp legal definition.
**Legal implication for the EU**: The [EU-Mercosur Agreement signed on 17 January 2026](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/ip_26_363) incorporates WTO principles on Technical Barriers to Trade (Chapter 5 TBT). The **"necessity" test of Article 2.2 TBT** obliges to assess whether the European threshold of 0.3% is **"more restrictive than necessary "** for the legitimate objective of distinguishing hemp from psychoactive cannabis.

When **3 out of 4 Mercosur members** (Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay) successfully operate at 1% THC without public safety problems, maintaining 0.3% constitutes an **unjustified technical barrier** that contradicts the regulatory harmonization commitments of the very agreement the EU has just ratified.

### Asia-Pacific and Africa

| Country | THC Limit | Legal Framework | Validity | Comments |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
**New Zealand** | â¤1.0% | Regulatory reform | Dec 2025 | Cultivation and products. |
| **Fiyi** | 1.0% | Illicit Drugs Control Act 2022 | Jul 2022 | Crop and products. |
| Australia** 1.0% | State legislation | Variable | Harvest threshold recognizes natural fluctuation of crop. |
| Morocco** | 1.0% | Law 13-21 + ANRAC | 2021 | Neighboring country and EU trading partner. |
| Lebanon** â¤1.0% | Law 178/2020 | Apr 2020 | Industrial Cannabis. |
| Malawi** â¤1.0% | Cannabis Regulation Act 2020 | May 2020 | Industrial Hemp. |
| Zimbabwe** | 1.0% | Criminal Law Amendment Bill | Feb 2023 | Industrial Hemp. |

**Note on China**: Although it does not set a specific THC limit for hemp, its breeding programs never artificially restricted this cannabinoid. Trials by Halker et al. (2024) documented that elite fiber varieties (Bama 0.506%, Yuma 0.723%) achieve yields of 22-35 t/ha - between 4-7 times higher than European varieties - precisely because **pure agronomic selection** naturally leads to the 0.4-0.9% THC range. The Brym et al. trials [18] confirmed this pattern: **all high-yielding Chinese varieties exceeded 0.3%** when grown to harvest. This confirms that the European threshold of 0.3% goes against the nature of the plant when optimized for maximum yield.

### Conclusion: strategic alignment

This overview evidences that the **1% THC** represents a mature balance between regulatory control and commercial viability, adopted by jurisdictions on all continents that have prioritized **sectoral competitiveness without compromising public safety**.

The European Union, by maintaining the 0.3% threshold, places itself at a **structural competitive disadvantage** vis-Ã -vis global producers operating with more realistic regulatory margins.

## 2.4 SOCIAL ARGUMENT: SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH

### 2.4.0 Evaluation framework: realism vs. theory

Concerns about the abuse potential of industrial hemp are **legitimate and should be rigorously evaluated**. However, this assessment should be conducted in a **realistic, not theoretical** manner.[^1].
The risk of abuse is not determined by the mere presence of THC in the plant, but by whether intoxication is **practically, technically and economically feasible**. Scientific and economic evidence shows that this **is not the case** for industrial hemp, even at 1% THC.

[^1]: EIHA, *Position Paper PAC 2028-2032* (2025): "Concerns about the potential abuse of industrial hemp must be assessed realistically, not theoretically. Abuse liability is not determined by the mere presence of THC, but by whether intoxication is practically, technically, and economically feasible."

### 2.4.1 What regulates this threshold

The proposed **1.0% THC** threshold operates as a criterion for **classification of industrial hemp raw materials** in the CAP/OCM framework, enabling their cultivation, marketing and importation within the internal market. These raw materials are intended for:

- **Industrial uses** (fiber, seed, biomass for processing).
- Production of legal products** which, once transformed, are **regulated by each Member State** according to the corresponding fit: industrial, food, cosmetic, medicinal or other sectorial frameworks.

The risk of **diversion or misuse** should not be managed by an artificially low threshold that punishes the farmer for agronomic or climatic variation. The correct approach is:

- **Clear regulation**: legal certainty, documentary traceability and official control with the harmonized EU method.
- Proportionality**: separate the percentage in plant (classification) from the specific risk management in final product or behaviors.

A robust CAP/OCM criterion (1%) combined with an effective control architecture protects the internal market better than a fragile threshold (0.3%) that generates litigation and losses without reducing the real risk of abuse.

### 2.4.2 Theoretical abuse scenarios: why they are unrealistic

To allow the misuse of industrial hemp for intoxicating purposes, the THC contained in the plant material would have to be consumed in sufficient quantities to induce a psychoactive effect. This could theoretically occur in two ways: **(a)** by ingestion of processed products (baking, extraction) or **(b)** by direct combustion (smoking or vaporizing).

#### A. Processed scenario (baking or extraction): irrelevant for this threshold.

The baking scenario has been examined as a theoretical form of misuse. In this case, industrial hemp flowers would first need to be processed - typically by extracting cannabinoids into a butter-like fat - which would then be incorporated into baked goods.

However, this method is subject to several limiting factors:

- **Substantial amount of material** to achieve a minimum intoxicating dose, posing palatability, digestibility and acceptability issues.
- **Incomplete conversion**: the transformation of the non-psychoactive precursor THCA into THC (decarboxylation) requires specific conditions. During baking, more than half of the potential THC may remain unconverted.
- Thermal degradation**: THC is thermolabile and degrades with excessive heat to cannabinol (CBN), a compound with no psychoactive effect.
**Critical note: This processing scenario is **just as feasible with 0.3% THC material** as with 1% material. If someone wanted to extract cannabinoids for domestic processing, they would simply need more 0.3% material to achieve the same result. The PAC/OCM classification threshold **does not alter this equation**: anyone with the intention, equipment and time to perform an extraction can do so with any material containing THC.

**Decisive economic argument**: Even assuming this scenario were technically feasible, **it would in no case constitute an attractive practice for drug trafficking**. Extracting THC from industrial hemp - whether at 0.3% or 1% - is **economically unviable** for the black market. An illicit operator would need to process between **13 and 43 times more biomass** to obtain the same amount of THC as he would extract from high-content (>13%) illicit cannabis, which is also widely available. The cost in raw materials, time, equipment and risk of detection makes this route completely irrational from any criminal perspective.

Therefore, **the processing scenario is not a valid argument** for maintaining an artificially low threshold: it is equally inefficient regardless of the threshold, and those seeking THC for illicit purposes have far more cost-effective alternatives.

#### B. Direct combustion scenario: the "realistic worst case".

Discarding the processing scenario as irrelevant, the only scenario that merits analysis is **direct combustion**: someone who, hypothetically, obtained industrial hemp material and smoked it.

##### B.1 Toxicological reference thresholds

To assess risk rigorously, we examined the thresholds available in the scientific and regulatory literature, ordered from the most conservative to the most permissive:

| Source | Dose | Route | Context |
|--------|-------|-----|----------|
| **EFSA CONTAM (2015)** [4] | **2.5 mg/day** | Oral | LOAEL (lowest observed adverse effects) |
**Perez-Reyes (1972)** [20] via EFSA | **3.1 Â± 0.9 mg** | i.v. | Dose for "desired marijuana high" |
**Grotenhermen (1998)** [19] | **0.8-1.0%** | Smoked | Threshold placebo/active discrimination |
**INTF Spain (2021)** [29] | **10 mg** | Oral | Minimum psychoactive (forensic) dose |

Critical remarks:** ** [29

1. **EFSA 2.5 mg is an oral LOAEL, not smoked.** EFSA [4] documents that the oral route generates **approximately 3Ã more active metabolite** (11-OH-THC) than smoking or vaporizing. However, the primary literature suggests that this factor may be underestimated: direct studies report 11-OH-THC/THC ratios of ~1:1 by the oral route versus ~1:10-1:20 by inhalation (actual factor ~10-20Ã) [11,15,16]. In either case, the equivalent threshold by inhalation is significantly higher than the oral LOAEL.

2. **The "desired marijuana high" requires ~3 mg systemic **According to Perez-Reyes [20], cited by EFSA [4], to reach the "desired high" by direct i.v. route requires **3.1 mg of circulating Î9-THC**.
3. **Grotenhermen established that the sensory discrimination threshold** [19] (the minimum concentration at which subjects distinguish cannabis from smoking placebo) is between **0.8% and 1.0% THC**. Material below 1% is hardly distinguishable from placebo.

##### Conversion of oral LOAEL to smoked equivalence

If we apply the documented conversion factors to the EFSA LOAEL (2.5 mg oral), we obtain the inhalation equivalent thresholds:

| oral/inhalation factor | smoked equivalent LOAEL | Source |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| **3Ã (EFSA conservative)** | | **7.5 mg** | EFSA 2015, Health Canada |
| **10Ã (central literature)** | | **25 mg** | Wall 1983, McGilveray 2005 |
| **20Ã (high literature)** | **50 mg** | Huestis 1992, direct ratio analysis |

**Decisive implication**: Even adopting EFSA's most conservative factor (3Ã), the equivalent LOAEL per inhalation would be **7.5 mg of systemic THC** - far in excess of the 1-2 mg that a full gram of 1% hemp can deliver.

With the most realistic factors in the literature (10-20Ã), the threshold stands at **25-50 mg systemic**, creating safety margins of **Ã12-50** with respect to the worst-case 1% hemp.

##### B.2 Correct pharmacokinetic quantification: the "worst case" of 1 gram at 1% THC

Scientific evidence documents that nominal THC in plant material **does not equal systemic THC**. Absorption by smoking involves **two sequential losses**:

1. **f_transfer** (material â mainstream smoke): only 12-37% of THC reaches the inhalable smoke.
2. **F_pulmonary** (smoke â blood): only 10-55% of inhaled THC reaches circulation.

**combined systemic f_transfer = f_transfer Ã F_pulmonary**.

Assume the **worst-case scenario**: someone rolls a large cigarette of **1 full gram** of 1% THC hemp and smokes it with optimal technique.

**Systemic bioavailability ranges:**[^pk1].

| Scenario | f_transfer | F_pulmonary | **f_systemic** | systemic THC (1g @ 1%) |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Conservative | 12% | 10% | **1,2%** | **0,12 mg** |
| Central | 20% | 25% | **5%** | **0.5 mg** | **0.5 mg** | Regulatory | 20% | 20% | 25% | **5%** | **0.5 mg** |

High (optimal) | 37% | 55% | **20%** | **2,0 mg** | **2,0 mg** |

Confrontation with intoxication thresholds:** ** **20%** **20%** **20%** **20

| Comparison | Outcome (systemic THC 0.12-2.0 mg) |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| vs EFSA LOAEL oral (2.5 mg) | **Ã1.3-21 lower** |
| **vs EFSA smoked LOAEL (7.5-50 mg systemic)** | **Ã4-417 less** | |
| vs "desired high" i.v. (3.1 mg) | ** **Ã1.5-26 less** | |
| vs INTF Spain oral (10 mg) ** **Ã5-83 less** | **Ã5-83 less** |

**Even in the most favorable scenario for exposure** (systemic f=20%), a full gram of 1% hemp smoked produces a systemic dose that is **1.5Ã below** the "desired marijuana high" documented by EFSA.

**At typical regulatory bioavailability (5-10%), the margin of safety is **3-6Ã**.
##### B.3 The typical scenario: normal cigarette

Using the recommended regulatory bioavailability (**5-10%** of nominal THC reaches systemic circulation):

| Scenario | Nominal THC | Systemic THC (5-10%) | vs "desired high" (3.1 mg) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Small cigarette (0.3 g @ 1%) | 3 mg | **0.15-0.30 mg** | **Ã10-21 less** | |
| Typical cigarette (0.5 g @ 1%) | 5 mg | **0.25-0.50 mg** | **Ã6-12 less** | |
| Large cigarette (1 g @ 1%) | 10 mg | **0.50-1.00 mg** | **Ã3-6 less** | **Ã3-6 less** |

### 2.4.3 Modulatory Effects and Additional Factors

#### Antagonistic effect of CBD

Industrial hemp strains contain significant levels of cannabidiol (CBD), which **antagonizes the effects of THC** at the CB1 receptor level. Typical CBD:THC ratios in hemp (2:1 to 17:1) provide a modulating effect that further reduces any psychoactive impact.[^cbd].

[^cbd]: Grotenhermen & Karus (1998); EIHA Position Paper (2025).

#### Economic impossibility of abuse

From an economic perspective, abuse of industrial hemp is **irrational**. Obtaining THC from hemp is **substantially more expensive, laborious and inefficient** than accessing high THC (>13%) illicit cannabis already available on the black market.

### 2.4.4.4 Safety Conclusion

Raising the threshold to 1% **does not alter the risk assessment**: the threshold refers to a field average under established controls, does not change the nature of the crop or enable psychoactive use.

**In practical terms, industrial hemp at 1% THC is comparable to "non-alcoholic" beer**: it may contain traces of a psychoactive substance, but **without realistic potential for intoxication**.

Accurate pharmacokinetic quantification demonstrates substantial safety margins:

- **Typical cigarette (0.5 g)**: systemic dose **6-12Ã lower** than the "desired high" and **15-100Ã lower** than the equivalent smoked LOAEL.
- Realistic worst case (1 g)**: systemic dose **3-6Ã lower** than the desired high and **4-50Ã lower** than the smoked LOAEL
- Only with >2 grams** and optimal bioavailability (20%) would the i.v. intoxication threshold be reached.

These **safety margins (4-417Ã) are much higher** than those applied to other legal products containing traces of psychoactive substances, and are based on direct pharmacokinetic evidence from verifiable PMID controlled human studies.

### 2.4.5 European precedent: more than a decade of uneventful sales

While scientific evidence supports the safety of 1% THC industrial hemp for inhalation, **the European practical precedent is even stronger**.

**Switzerland** has allowed since 2011 the free sale of hemp flowers (<1% THC) as an **alternative to tobacco**, marketed in tobacconists, supermarkets and specialty stores. **Luxembourg** has adopted the same approach under its *Tobacco Control Act*, allowing hemp products up to 1% THC as tobacco substitutes.
Beyond these formal frameworks, **multiple member states allow de facto marketing of hemp flowers** for smoking under various regulatory interpretations: **Austria, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Czech Republic and France**, among others, have active markets for CBD flowers in specialty stores. Although not all Member States have established specific registration frameworks for these products, **the commercial reality is that hemp flowers have been sold for inhalation in Europe for more than a decade**.

**The most relevant fact: no Member State has reported any public health incidents associated with these products.

This empirical precedent strengthens the scientific argument and raises a question of regulatory consistency:

> **If the TFEU protects the free circulation of products that do not constitute harm to public health** - and industrial hemp flowers clearly are not, as demonstrated by more than a decade of incident-free marketing - **then the real harm to public health comes from regulatory inaction**.

The absence of a harmonized framework generates:

- **Untraced operators**: traders operating in gray areas without registration or oversight.
- Products without quality control**: absence of sanitary standards, pesticides, heavy metals or microbiological contaminants.
- Legal uncertainty**: farmers and companies exposed to arbitrary interpretations by national authorities.
- Fragmented market**: barriers to mutual recognition that contradict the principles of the internal market.

**The urgency is not to prohibit what is already safe, but to regulate what is already legal. A harmonized threshold at 1% THC, combined with the traceability and quality controls that the CAP and the CMO make it possible to implement, would turn a *de facto* uncontrolled market into a *de jure* traceable, controlled and safe sector.

---
# 3. CONCLUSION AND PROPOSED AMENDMENT

## 3.1 Proposal

Cannabis Hub proposes to **replace the 0.3% threshold with 1.0% THC** in all CAP and CMO provisions where this criterion operates as a definition of **industrial hemp**, maintaining the existing control architecture and adding a **minimum technical clause** that closes the interpretative ambiguity.

This reform:
- **Resolves** the fragmentation of the internal market and documented legal uncertainty.
- Protects** the farmer against losses due to agronomic and climatic variability ("hot crops").
- Aligns** the EU with the international bloc of 1% (18 verified jurisdictions) and strengthens its competitiveness.
- Maintains** official control through the EU harmonized method (Delegated Reg. 2017/1155).

> Note on CN 1211 90 86**: This code ("other parts of the hemp plant") is the key novelty of COM(2025) 553, including for the first time **flowers, tops and biomass** in the CMO regulatory framework. It is precisely this category that requires a robust threshold (1%) to enable the value chain of **CBD extracts** and derived products.

---

## 3.3 Recommended minimum technical clause

To avoid litigation due to divergent interpretations, it is recommended that a technical reference be added to both instruments:

> * *"For the purposes of this Regulation, the tetrahydrocannabinol (Î9-THC) content shall be determined **on a dry matter basis (constant weight)** and in accordance with the **Union method** set out in Annex III to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1155, or in the act replacing it. "* * *"*".

---

## 3.4 Conclusions

Raising the threshold to **1.0% THC** is not a maximalist request: it is the coherent closure of the reasoning that the European Parliament itself and the industry have initiated. The same arguments that justify 0.5% - proportionality, agronomic reality, competitiveness, internal market - more solidly justify 1%, further supported by:

- **Primary evidence**: the originator of 0.3% (Dr. Ernest Small) states that practical abuse potential requires ~1% total THC.
- **Consolidated international block**: 18 jurisdictions operate with 1% with no control issues.
- Technical compatibility**: EU method works without modification with the new threshold.

The proposed reform will allow the hemp sector to fully contribute to EU objectives in bioeconomy, climate resilience and strategic autonomy, with a **harmonized, operable and defensible** regulatory framework.
